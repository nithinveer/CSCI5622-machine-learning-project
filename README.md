## Abstract
The popularity of a hotel is not only based on the brand but also the user reviews and testimonials in current online world. To select or to book a hotel online, users would verify the reviews and assess the reputation based on the reviews and testimonials received by the hotel so far. We aim to bring out the key features which not only maintains the hotel reputation and popularity but also identify those key features and areas which lack appreciation or needs an improvement.

#	Conclusion:
As mentioned, we have made an attempt to figure out the feature importance by above approach. This approach yielded good results for a hotel where the diversity on features are good. For a hotel reviews which lacks diversity of features didnâ€™t yield a meaning full result. We could have made some improvements using some prior tagging or labelling the features that would be under consideration.  This whole project would have been dealt with multiple possible approaches and above is one of the approaches. This approach is more of experimental and learning strategy by implementing some of the machine learning algorithms described in the class.
