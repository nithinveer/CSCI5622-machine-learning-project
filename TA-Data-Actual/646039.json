[{"title": "Lovely", "review": "It is a very pleasant place to have a rest. We had 2 rooms, a great balcony with a magnificent lake view. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were cosy, everything was clean. There were additional blankets in case it got too cool. We used them twice on the balcony unable  to resist the pleasure of seeing the lake and the mountains. If you want to use the safe ask for the key at check in. It is free. If you want to use the kitchenette, it will cost 15 euro a day.  The breakfast was good: it included a few kinds of cheese, sausage, ham, fruit, eggs, juices, tea, coffee, pastries. One can have a dinner starting from 7 p.m. There is a number of restaurants nearby, a supermarket. The place is great for walking and biking: there are numerous paths waiting to be explored. It is convenient to visit the lake towns - Limone, Malcesine, Riva del Garda, Salo and others. If you have never been there and are planning to go ther by car, use the SP 115 road from Limone, then merging with SP 38 (keep left). The staff was friendly and helpful.\u2026", "date": "September 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664156-d646039-r620546040", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Great View, basic Facilities, problematic location", "review": "This hotel is located in the highlands of Tremosine. I am starting with this detail because reaching this place from Garda Lake is a challenge not to say a driving risk. Arriving at night could be a nightmare. The roads are very very narrow with a place for one car and this is two-way road. For people with height problems it may be a nightmare. Obviously, this detail is not mentioned in none of hotel details.  The hotel itself Is more of a village motel, several villas scattered around and main building with rooms. We got the Villa as we were 4 adults and needed two bed rooms. This hotel is ranked with 4 stars which I wonder why because the facilities in the hotel are very basic. Yes it has a pool and yes it has beautiful view of Garda lake but all in-rooms / shower facilities are very basic and poorly designed. Also sleeping quality was not so good; the combined pillow, mattress didn\u2019t work for me. The mattress quality for us was very low.  Wifi is free as can expected but very weak signal within the rooms.  Breakfast was fine, but basic thing like fresh mile is not around (only long-life milk). The hotel also has restaurant with reasonable prices but the food was very disappointing.  The service was mediocre. Beside one service desk person all the rest where quite correct. Last thing to mention, this is a very German vacation location. The owner is German and most of the staff is German speakers but no English. The hotel folder in the rooms is in two languages, Italian and Germany no English.\u2026", "date": "September 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664156-d646039-r619895676", "sub_review": {"Location": 2, "Rooms": 2, "Service": 2}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Best view of Lake Garda and best drive to get there; Strada della Forra", "review": "The best view ever, and the best scenic drive to get to this resort.

It's hard to imagine a more perfect setting for a hotel. Up in hills above Lake Garda this hotel really is ideally placed for exploring the north of the lake. It's a 15 minute drive down to the lakeside but those 15 minutes are buying you tranquillity and stunning views.  The hotel pool is the best I've seen. Perfect temperature and spotlessly clean. The manager was brilliantly helpful and have great advice about how to get out and about and what to do. The apartment was perfect for us. Every apartment has lake views and ours was plenty big enough. There's no air conditioning but big ceiling fans kept us plenty cool enough and you're a few degrees below lakeside temperate anyway.  Breakfast was fine. Not perfect (things ran out and they was no proper fruit juice) but perfectly adequate.  People have complained about the dice up to the hotel. We were in a hire car and I'm no Lewis Hamilton but it honestly was fine. Just take it steady and toot as you approach a blind corner. We loved how peaceful the whole hotel felt. We could have spent the whole time just lying by the pool and enjoying the view... but there is so much to see down below.

We were greeted with wonderful views overlooking Lake Garda and the hotel staff went out of their way to make us welcome. The accommodation was excellent, extremely clean and the hotel is beautifully maintained.
