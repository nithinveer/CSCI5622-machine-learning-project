Definitely not 5*", "review": "Stayed here with my family for 11 nights, from last week in August to first week of September.  My first impression was that this hotel was very clean and still relatively new. The decor and design quality of the building was quite impressive from the outside and inside the lobby. And although quite small compared to neighbouring hotels, the building  seemed of a much higher standard than the others. But the man at reception was not very professional - certainly not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. He couldn't even manage a smile when we approached him. He just stood behind his desk and made no effort to help me get our luggages and pushchair through their awkward revolving door into the hotel from the taxi.  We arrived very late at night (around 1am) after a long drive from Antalya airport with 2 small kids (3 and 5), all very tired, and no one at reception to help us with our luggages. Even though we had reserved our room well in advance and prepaid, the man at the desk spent ages trying to find our booking. He kept asking me if I had any other documentary proof of the booking. Finally, after what seemed like ages, he found my reservation and showed us to our room. To my surprise and disappointment, the room was quite small for a family of 4, and had only 1 king size bed and 1 single. When I asked for a larger family room, I was told I would have to pay more money as my agent had only reserved a standard room. But I was led to believe I had paid for, and would get, a room which could accommodate a family of 4 comfortably. Anyway, we were far too tired to argue at that time of the night and just accepted the room. The following day. I went to reception and requested an additional bed. The man at reception said he would take care of it. By the time we returned to our rooms later that afternoon, they had put a bed sheet over the 2 seater sofa with a pillow. That was obviously not what we had in mind when we asked for an additional bed.   I had contacted the hotel several days before our arrival to ask if it would be possible to have some food when we arrive, and got a reply saying they would have some snacks for us in the restaurant at that time. But when we got to the restaurant, there was no food there - just some cut pieces of old fruits on a plate.  The beach was tiny compared to others we've stayed at in Antalya. Instead of putting up proper sun shades, they put these extremely annoying umbrella-type shades which do absolutely nothing to protect you from the blistering sun and heat. People were constantly moving the shades to avoid the sun.  But on a positive note, the quality of the sand was absolutely amazing. Very soft and smooth. No stones or shells at all.  Another big negative was the lack of ice cream served at the beach or the hotel. A very limited selection of Ice cream was only served at the beach between 3pm and 4pm. That was pretty poor.  Food in the main restaurant was quite good overall. There was a decent variety on offer each day. But I was very disappointed to find that both A la Carte restaurants were closed for the entire period of our stay, even though we had paid for an all inclusive package which included 2 meals in the A la Carte restaurants.  The staff at the Spa salon were a bit too pushy when it came to selling their services, which put me off a little. But I decided to treat my wife to a massage anyway. The man from the spa showed me their list of services and individual masseuses. I chose a female masseuse and booked the massage for the following day. My wife went alone the following day while I looked after the kids. When she arrived at the spa, she asked for the female masseuse, but she was told she would get her all over body massage done by a man because the lady I chose was not available. While I was sure the man was very professional, I was still very uncomfortable with the idea. I paid and even gave him a tip, but decided never to return.  All in all, I would say this hotel is not really the best for families with small children. They have a very tiny kid's club with a great lady (Julia) looking after the kids, but after a few days my kids were starting to get seriously bored. We had to take them out of the hotel to other resorts and amusement parks to keep them entertained.  Staff in general did not speak much English but mainly spoke German and some Russian. The majority of guests were German. Some waiters in the main restaurant would rush to find you a table, then blatantly ask for tips, just for doing their jobs. I did tip them a couple of times, but then they expected me to do the same every day, and when I stopped, they began ignoring me and my family. One of them actually ignored me when I tapped him on the shoulder and said hello at the beach. I was shocked! My fault for being too friendly with the help I guess.  On 2 separate occasions I tried to take my 5 year old to the games room which has a pool table and some games machines. I went to reception and a lady called Ayse said I needed to pay extra for the games. 10 Euros per hour for the pool, and 2 Euros per game for the machines. I had to pay cash in advance but I only had Turkish Lira on me at that time.  I asked if she could change my 100TL to EUR so I could play the games machines with my 5yr old. She said the exchange rate would be 5TL to 1EUR. I gave her a 100TL note, and she just gave me 10EUR in coins instead of 20EUR, and walked away. When I asked for the rest of my EUR, she said \"you should give that to us as tip\" I went to the games room and discovered that the games machine did not work - it was not accepting any coins. i went back to reception to report it. Ayse had left but another rude lady just said to me, \"it's kaput!\" and walked off. They never even offered to give me back my money. My 5yr old was very upset.  When we returned a couple of days later, the machine was still out of order but they had not put a sign on it warning guests about this. People were still putting 2 EUR coins in. Then my son wanted to play the Nintendo game on their computer, but that didn't work either. Strange games room!  Another rather irritating thing about this hotel is the water slides at the kid's pool. They kept closing it and switching the water off after only a couple of hours each day. I really couldn't see the point of this. Everyone (kids and adults) would be enjoying the slides when suddenly they would shut the water off and close it for a few hours.  To summarise, I would say this is a very clean, small hotel with the potential to be much better than it is at the moment. It is better suited for adults only, with decent food, terrible drinks (they have no idea how to make the most basic cocktails, no fresh juice unless you pay extra, and all drinks were lukewarm), located quite far away from everywhere, with some very poorly trained staff. The general manager was neither available nor approachable. i sat next to him once in the lobby area, and he never once spoke to a guest or made himself available when there was a problem. He just sat on the balcony staring at his phone.  Would I ever return to this hotel? I'm afraid not. Much better hotels in Antalya for families.\u2026", "date": "September 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d7809477-r617675256", "sub_review": {"Rooms": 3, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 2}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Excellent 5* Hotel in Antalya", "review": "My family and I had a fantastic experience here and cannot recommend it highly enough.

The hotel appears classy, is very clean, food is good, lovely sandy beach a short walk away and staff are helpful.

Fizzy drinks are available in plenty but an iced coffee or fresh juice at breakfast is charged extra!!
