Glasses and cigarettes were lying around the bungalows. The staff was not very kind, especially the lady who did the deposit control at the end of our stay. She was very unpleasant and not professional at all. She did not even say hello or goodbye, just looked at the place and said it was not clean enough, even though I told her, that we did not clean it yet (no one told us that the control is not just for the damage deposit but for cleaning also). Equipment of the bungalow was very poor and dated. Deposit for possible damage is 150 eur. If you do not clean yourself, it will cost you 58 eur. This would be a great place if they renovated the bungalows and if they hired professional staff. Cleaning of the house should be included in the price, so that place would be clean.   The location is very beautiful, each bungalow has its own private place between the olive trees and it is very intimate and peaceful.
