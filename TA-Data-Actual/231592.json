Had a choice between using the tub in one room or the shower in the other room.  Yes, there were two separate rooms.  The shower head was amazing.  Could have stood there all day after a long day of travelling. The air-conditioning worked well, no issues which was important because it was SO HOT outside!  We booked directly with the hotel website and we received a free breakfast and two bottles of water (which we used at Alhambra).  Breakfast was very nice.  Plenty of choices at the buffet.  There is also a menu at the tables which indicates different styles of eggs you can order- no extra charge.  Had dinner at the hotel. The pizza, burger and salmon were very good.  Staff were very nice and accommodating.  They spoke English well.  They provided maps and recommendations on what to do in Granada.

She advised we parked further down and then the man will come and take our car and park it offsite somewhere.. Payed 18euros for that service, Bit much if you ask us. We sat in our car with hazards on until he arrived as it was not safely out the way.. We figured parking is a real issue in granada.

It is a nice 15 minute walk down a wide tree lined pathway into Granada, it is quite a gradient and cobbled and uneven in parts so nice to walk down but we got a taxis back for 5 euros, we also bought a 2 day pass for the small city train the green route stops at the Alhambra.

Granada is not easy by car.... but as you find yourself right next to the wall of the Alhambra you feel that you are somewhere special.... and when the hotel take your car away you have arrived.  Easy and early check-in was great.... with very few guests the hotel was so quiet.  Plush decor.... dark tones.... modern and old styles mixed.... the place is just syle personified.  Our room on the 4th floor had a juliet balcony facing the Alhambra.... Magical.  The bedrooms are darkly decorated but also well illuminated.... a bath tub, twin sinks, shower toilet and bidet.... with two internal doors makes it seem special.

A little bit harder to walk back from the center since it's up hill, but worth the walk. Service at the hotel was amazing, the bar at the pool wasn't opened yet, but we ordered in the lobby and they brought it up for us once we had changed for the pool. The pool was a perfect temperature and a beautiful area to lay out. Rooms were quiet and very tranquil. They parked our car for us in the Alhambra parking area and at a discount.
