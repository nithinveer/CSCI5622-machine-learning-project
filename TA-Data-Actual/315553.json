[{"title": "Thailand Holiday- Couples", "review": "This was the first time that we went to Thailand. We were recommended the hotel from a travel company. Overall it was good it terms of location, relaxing areas e.g pools and food places.  We had a few issues on arrival which tainted the start of our holiday. We got assigned a room but the sound was horrendous outside, it was a million crickets and frogs outside the room.  The doors didn\u2019t close properly so the sound was ridiculous. The hotel was accommodating and showed us 5 different rooms. We were much more comfortable after changing rooms. The staff were very helpful and understood our issues.  Other thing is that the hotel is so tired looking the pool is missing all the grout from each of the 3 pools fairly dangerous for children. Also in the height of summer holidays I can see the hotel getting very busy and crowded. The breakfast area is way too small, we had to queue on a couple of days and that wasn\u2019t the busiest it could be.   Overall good hotel but not amazing for the 4* rating.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1215780-d315553-r728882055", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Great Family Resort with lovely staff", "review": "We checked out today after staying in a superior room with my partner and son and my parents were next door.

It only takes less than a minute to put ice cubes in a glass and get two cans of soda from the fridge.  2. Thai food- Bland. I was expecting more in terms of flavour given that it's a Novotel resort but I found the Thai food pretty ordinary. I found the dishes rather bland and lacking in wow factor.

Rooms were well presented and house keeping was generally good. We found it a bit of a pain with timing for having our room cleaned as it varies so much, for example sometimes cleaned before lunch but at other times not cleaned until after 6pm. Also towels are not always replaced, one might be changed but the other left?   Breakfast was really good- so much choice and we never had a problem being seated. Meals weren't too expensive but of course more so than in town.   Location is ok- it is a 5/10 minute walk to town but it is nice to be out of the way of the hustle and bustle.

There came some noise into the room but not disturbingly. King bed was over 2 metres wide and soft so good sleep is guaranteed. Housekeeping worked well and room was clean all the time.

If you are looking for a quiet location, then this is your hotel. It's 100Mts from the Karon beach and it's a bit far (30 minutes drive) from the Patong beach (Main area in Phuket). I liked the location. 2. Value for money: It's not the cheapest, but still it's a good value for your money. 3. Restaurants: There are 4 restaurants in the hotel - which is a great thing.

A large super-king bed in a spacious bedroom with French doors opening out to the plunge pool, a two-sink bathroom with separate bath, big shower, plenty of shelf and counter space (a lack of towel rails or hooks though).

The SPA Was outstanding! The staff, very friendly, take care of us very good everyday. The hotel has 3 pools and a nice fitness center.

We were about 25 people, young and old asking for the music but they still wouldnt turn it on.. It feelt like we were staying at a home for old people and not at a nice hotel. The barpool staff couldnt understand why we couldnt have music on! The atmosphere was killed every day because of this!

To have one corner of this  at a different music setting actually  draws complaints from guests around the pool. So we have the Champions bar music set at a more up tempo  genre.
