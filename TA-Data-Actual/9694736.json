[{"title": "Good cost benefit", "review": "We stayed two nights in Urban Dream Nevada. The room is simple, but it was confortable, clean, and it had a table and chair for two people (it helps if you want to eat something in the room). The only part that wasn\u2019t so nice was the shower,  it was really small, hard to move inside. There\u2019s no separation for the bathroom, it\u2019s inside the room, it has only a glass door separating the toilet and the shower, so everybody stays together. :D In the reception they have a microwave, plates, glasses, cutlery, and it helps a lot if you plan to eat something in the room. It also have a super market in the street in front of the hotel, so you may by water and food there (it\u2019s easy, you can go walking). The crew is great! Very willing to help! The provide us al the kitchen utensils that we needed and opened our wine for us! ;) It\u2019s easy to park in front of the hotel, but it\u2019s far from Alhambra and the center of the city (you\u2019ll have to drive these places).\u2026", "date": "February 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1989939-d9694736-r655497202", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "KNOW WHAT YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU ARE  NOT GETTING", "review": "We had room 123, First Floor, no \"personal\" toiletries, just a dispenser on the shower wall and on the wall of the area of the handbasin. Everything being separate. The shower was a decent sized cubicle.The toilet was separate, but a bit squashed. The hand basin is in a little alcove next to the Bed. We had no \"black out curtains\", just one net curtain, so the room was illuminated all night by the street light. Nice twin beds. Rock hard pillow.No hair dryer, no telephone, no coffee/tea-making facilities. No mini fridge. However, the staff were lovely, and the Breakfast at 7 Euros per head was a real feast. There is parking underground at 6 Euros per night, but if you can find a parking space in the Hotel circumference, it is free, but we were also told that in Granada, overnight parking is allowed in most places till 8am . So know what you are getting, and what you are not getting, for what has to be an excellent price for a major town with so many attractions.

We are very pleased with the hotel service and accommodation, the staff also is very friendly and helpful when you have some question like we had to buy our entrance tickets for the Alhambra, they also provided us a city map, so no need to look after a Tourist Information Center. In the hotel you have the choice to park your car on the public parking in front of the hotel, or to take the option of the private and covered parking of the hotel for this option they will cover you 6\u20ac a day, we took this option and are very pleased with it. The breakfast is in buffet form and very good, viewed price/quality. The room is spacious and very clean, you have everything you need, separated toilet, shower, flat screen TV, and free wireless Internet. The hotel is located at about 10 km by car from the Alhambra,  As we did not booked our visit of  the Alhambra online, so leaved the hotel early in the morning and so we arrived at 08h00 on the location and there was no problem to get our tickets, even as there were no more tickets available online the day before. The only inconvenience was that we had to wait until 12h00 to be able to enter the Palace, we can tell that it is need to take the complete visit of 14\u20ac pro person, when you like to have an audio guide you have to pay above the entrance price, and the parking will cost you 10\u20ac. To pay your entrance tickets be advised that you only can pay with liquid money, they do not accept any Bankcard or Credit Card. And to visit the historic city center the best solution is when you do not take the Hop On \u2013 Hop Off, is to leave your car into the covered car park of Triunfo located on the \u201cAvenida de la Constituicion\u201d. Please be shure to wear good shoes for your visit, because you have allot of stairs to do also. We were very happy with our visit and the hotel, and can warmly recommend the hotel.\u2026", "date": "March 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1989939-d9694736-r466812459", "sub_review": {"Sleep Quality": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled solo", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Simple, clean, price is right.", "review": "Came to area to visit ski area with the children and also decided to take in the new shopping mall.

Place is very simple, beds comfortable, and clean bathrooms. Food service for breakfast was good too.  Not luxury, but if you want a good deal on a place to sleep, this is one safe bet.

A local friend recommended this hotel so we booked it for one night. I believe I paid less than 40 euros so prior to arriving at this hotel, I was expecting a run down place. However, when I arrived, I was surprised to find a modern looking hotel, which didn't have the looks of a budget hotel.  The only negative was the room I was given, which was a room on the ground floor, which was across the reception desk, behind glass doors that didn't close well. When the reception was busy with guests, you could hear everything going on in the reception area because the glass doors didn't provide a good enough seal to insulate the noise.

The room was spacious but felt a little like we were staying in a portacabin. The bed was large and comfortable with particularly nice pillows. The room was a bizarre layout in that the shower and toilet were part of the bedroom and next to the bed. The shower was warm and powerful and the facilities were clean.  Wifi was available in the room and the connection was strong enough to sustain us steaming videos.  The hotel itself is located in an urban area on the outskirts of Granada. There is a busy road right next to the hotel and the general environment means the small pool area is not the most attractive space to spend time.

It was two beds even though we requested a double (we saw the same setup in several rooms), but the bedding was fantastic. Air con was good too. And the shower had great water pressure and tons of hot water, even during the busiest time in the morning. The hotel also had fantastic coffee for a euro.
