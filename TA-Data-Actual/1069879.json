Some rooms are facing the ocean, while others offer the views of the wild mountains. The scenery was remarkable and dramatic even in bad weather. Comfortable room. The entradas and postres served in the restaurant were delicious. Main dishes could be improved. In room wi-fi was a bit flimsy.

Breakfast had a bit of everything and we were seating outside looking at the sea and the hills. You can make your own fresh orange juice, tea and coffee. There were eggs, cheese and cold meats, cereals, some fruit and yoghourts,...  There was a charge of 10 euros for renting a beach towell which the receptionist kindly reduced to 5 euros.
