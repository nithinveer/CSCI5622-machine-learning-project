The owners & staff are welcoming & lovely! The chef is brilliant - food, wine & service excellent. A very homely atmosphere. It was Sabiote's Medieval Fiesta & we were in the heart of it. Fabulous weekend in a fabulous hotel!

His expert advice absolutely made our holiday, we could never have seen so much in a few days without his advice.  The staff are all friendly and helpful.

As expected, Manuel, his wife and his small staff were on their game, providing us with congenial hospitality.  We decided to have dinner at the hotel as Manuel told us he was cooking his famous lamb dish. OMG! The lamb was extraordinary! He personally selected an excellent wine to accompany the dinner. During dinner he took time to visit each table of diners and chat with them.  The breakfast is the traditional Spanish bocadilla with choices of toppings, coffee and juice.

Sabiote is about 5 km North from its large and more well-known neighbor town. The road immediately under the old city wall near the old castle offered stunning, at least 80 km views of Andaluc\u00eda. In the far distance several Sierras including the Sierra de Cazorla and the Sierra Magina were visble, more close by millions (?) of olive trees. The only industry you will notice in this part of Spain are olive oil factories.  We liked our stay in this old atmospheric palacio.

The hotel is located in a quiet village (felt like we were the first tourists to ever visit as we were being watched by the local villagers), yet close to cities such as Ubeda and Baeza which are definitely worth visiting.   The hotel is more of a hacienda which managed to keep its local charm. It's being run by a family. Their English is not fluent but we managed to have some conversations using our bad Spanish and mainly invented kind of sign language. The rooms are big and charming with high ceilings. As it is a hacienda the windows are very small and you will not have a view. It also makes the room a bit dark.  We also had breakfast but the menu was already decided for us.
