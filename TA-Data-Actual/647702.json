Lunches in Tate Island Grill superb and service particularly good from all staff and staff serving drinks poolside. The only staff we found poor and unfriendly were located in the coffee shop in the lobby. Think they may have been Eastern European or one was. Gym small but ok for gentle workout. Nice touch was the firepit by Tate Island Grill and also patio heaters as we had few unusually cool nights. We had to call out their engineer to fix Netflix on our TV.

I believe that you probably prefer more modern, contemporary style of resort.  If you choose not to come back to the Sandpearl I suggest you try our sister property Opal Sands located 1 mile south of us.  Your stay with us was during one of the slowest times of the year from us so we did have a couple of projects going on the that week.  The construction you mentioned was due to replacing our boardwalk that leads to our private beach.  That project is done and it looks great.  We were also updating and improving our pool filtration system which did have an impact on the pool temperature for a couple days.  That project is complete now as well and the pool is at a very comfortable 82 degrees.

We are happy to see that you enjoyed many aspects of the resort such as the beach and location.  In your review you commented on a couple of items that I would like to explain.  The loungers are set back from the water approximately 50 yards.  The reason for this is that the location of our chairs on the beach is on our private property.  The area in front of our beach is public.  In the area where our chairs are you can eat and drink whatever you like while you cannot do this on the public beach. Plus we have servers that bring items to you upon your request.  We do have a very active pool.  It is the centerpiece to our entire resort.  With this said it is common for people who are not guests to try to sneak in.  There is no preventing this other than what we are already doing by having our Pool Security Team keep out non-guests.  The reason there are locks on the gates is to keep non-guests our of the pool so carrying your room key is necessary.

Let me start by saying the Hotel, Lobby, and STAFF were outstanding. They were more than adequately staffed from the front door to the beach. The hotel itself was beautiful.

If you have children 2 - 12 years old, this is your resort!! We are an adult couple. The pool was dominated from 10am to sunset by very young children end to end, primarily being watched from chairs. BOTH hot tubs were occupied all day by very young kids with squirts guns and water wings. There is no haven for adults without kids.

We should have however done a better job at making sure that the kids around the pool were not being a nuisance to others.  I will speak to the Pool and Beach team regarding your comments.  I am sorry that you did not like the view from your room.  There are some rooms with the views that you mention however we price them accordingly when compared to Gulf View or Gulf Front rooms.  Some people prefer to pay a little less and dont mind the view as they will not be in their room that often.  Also, in the loading dock area is where the compactor, smoker and recycling bin are located.  Trust me that there are no health concerns in that area as the compactor is totally sealed and contained and the recycling bin is for cardboard products only.  Again, thank you for your feedback.

We were able to change to room 619, 2 stories higher and one room closer to the beach. Better view and smell! I highly recommend this hotel; just be careful which room you get. Also highly recommend the smoking Bleu burger at Tate's grill, poolside! (I added white cheddar.) Their basket of fries will easily feed 2-3 adults.

Two caveats - I'm kind of comparing this vacation to a vacation we took last year where we stayed at the Tween Waters Inn on Captiva Island, FL.  Obviously very different areas since Captiva/Sanibel have a building height restriction and the area is much more low key. Also, we stayed over Mother's Day weekend, and if that wasn't the case, maybe the hotel could've gotten us a full ocean view room a lot easier.

You are correct in saying that those views are not direct Gulf View rooms and overlook other parts of Clearwater Beach.  The direct Gulf View Rooms do have our premium views and come with a premium price.  In your review you also compared Clearwater Beach to Sanibel and Captiva.  As you stated both areas are very different and it depends on what you are looking for in a vacation when you choose a destination.  Captiva is a much more secluded area with a more tropical feel where Clearwater Beach has more things to do within walking distance.  Both beaches are very nice but Clearwater Beach definitely has the better beach experience.  Again, thank you for your review.  We appreciate the feedback.

This is a really good hotel with friendly staff and very good service.  Upgraded on arrival to gulf view king room for additional $50 per night. Additional bed they supplied for my teenage son was poor. Very lumpy, springs showing and creaked every time he moved. In hindsight we should have opted for a double queen room but couldn't face packing up to move. As other reviewers have said the loungers by the pool are too close together and we also witnessed the large American family who saved 8 poolside loungers at 8am one day and then disappeared to the aquarium until 3pm.

I will also speak with our Spa Manager about your comments and focus on retraining the associates in our locker rooms.

Also, thank you very much for joining us for you third time!  We appreciate the repeat business.  I am very happy to hear that you love our resort but sorry to hear about the noise issues you experienced on Memorial Day Weekend.  Memorial Day Weekend is perhaps the busiest weekend of the year.  With that said we do have systems in place to control the guests around the pool.  It appears that we need to reinforce them better however.  First of all, only registered guests are allowed to use the pool.  Although it might have appeared that guests who were not staying here were with them, we check everyone around the pool to make sure that they are staying with us.  We have a Security Guard who checks all names of people who do not have wristbands. Also, guests are not permitted to bring their own coolers or alcoholic drinks to the pool.  This is policed as well.  On that particular day, I personally noticed that there were several people around the pool using their own portable Bluetooth speakers and playing their own music.  I had a conversation with the management team and reinforced our policy on them.  Amplified music around the pool of any sort is strictly forbidden.  I am sorry that one day exceptions were made that should not have been.  The vision for our pool area is to be a place to relax and unwind.  It is not a party pool, so again I apologize this happened.  I most definitely hope that you reconsider and decide to stay with us again.

I cannot understand guests who leave rubbish i.e. cups, wrappers etc around the place after them as there were plenty of bins provided & a favourite place to leave these items were under the sunbeds - very unsightly & not necessary. While this is not the hotels fault , it lets them down slightly in my opinion. The Tate grill served some great food & the staff here are particularly pleasant.

I appreciate the feedback.    Please accept my apologies for the maintenance issues you had in your room.  That is definitely not acceptable and not our norm.  My apologies for the availability of the amenities in your bathroom as well.  This is the first time I am hearing of this so I am not sure if it was an inventory issue or a Room Attendant that missed it. Either way, I am sorry.   Regarding the eco-friendliness of our resort I was a bit confused by your comments.  The plastic cups that we use are made from plants, that is true.  It is also true that if they are left empty on the hot pool deck for an extended period of time they could become flimbsy due to the hot August Florida heat.  Regardless, we feel that the eco-friendliness is a better solution than common plastic and paper cups would not work for serving beverages.  The bags we use in the room should be replaced daily.  If that didn't happen I apologize.  Re-using the bags would not be a sanitary solution and would be frowned upon by many guests.  The Sandpearl Resort is a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) property.  At the time it was built it was the only hotel in the state of Florida and one of only a handful in the country.  Our focus on the environment is very strong and we do our best to balance our eco-responsibility as well as maintaining a high standard of service to all of our guests.

First of all was the Bell Service.  45 minutes is way to long to wait for your luggage.  You are correct.  This is normally delivered within minutes of your arrival to your room.  I am not sure what happened but it is not the norm and definitely not acceptable.  My apologies.  Regarding the shutters, we do receive mixed reviews on these.  A majority of the people to like them as they allow the guest to relax in their tub should they choose and enjoy the view of the Gulf.  While the shutters do close, there is a privacy concern from some.  We will look into seeing if the is an option to attach locking mechanisms.  We charge for umbrellas on the beach not only for the additional revenue but for the guest satisfaction piece as well.  We previously did not charge for umbrellas and guests would reserve chairs and umbrellas on the beach and the pool at the same time and therefore we would not have enough chairs and umbrellas for all guests.  Once we put a charge on the umbrellas this problem ended.  We hope you understand.  I am also very sorry to hear about your poor dining experience at Caretta on the Gulf.

There were a lot of families with young children during the time we stayed at the Sandpearl.  Here's what we did and a few tips that you may find helpful:  Poolside:  Guests claim the loungers early, so when you wake up head down to the pool and reserve places for yourself and family members.  You do this by asking for towels and covers from the poolside service desk.  One of their folks will help you put your covers on the loungers you've selected.  Leave a book or flip flops on your loungers and head to breakfast. \u2026", "date": "December 2015", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d647702-r338172645", "sub_review": {"Location": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Excellent Beachfront Hotel", "review": "Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for the kind words about your recent stay with us at Sandpearl Resort.

In your review you mentioned being disappointed about the charge for beach umbrellas. In past reviews we have addressed this issue as it is a point of contention for some guests. The reason for this charge is due to giving the resort an opportunity to manage the availability of the chairs better. In the past we did not charge for beach chairs and some guests would reserve chairs on both the beach and the pool. This left no availability for many guests. We found the best means to control this was to place a minimal charge on these umbrellas. We currently charge less than other local hotels or the public beach umbrellas. I hope this clears things up.

I hope your children enjoyed the dolphin tale movie that was sent up by the front desk; their attentiveness to detail will be recognized!   In your review you mentioned being disappointed about the charge for beach umbrellas. In past reviews we have addressed this issue as it is a point of contention for some guests. The reason for this charge is due to giving the resort an opportunity to manage the availability of the chairs better. In the past we did not charge for beach chairs and some guests would reserve chairs on both the beach and the pool. This left no availability for many guests. We found the best means to control this was to place a minimal charge on these umbrellas. We currently charge less than other local hotels or the public beach umbrellas.   As for the Wi-Fi network, I apologize you were unable to connect to our network. We are in the process of upgrading of network to be able to withhold the larger amount of guests we have.

I would suggest that next time you can get a taxi from the airport as you really do not need a car while you are with us as there are many things to do in the local area that are within walking distance.    We also do charge for umbrellas on the beach.  The reason for this charge is to guarantee that guests do not reserve chairs on the pool deck and the beach.  Previously there was not a charge for umbrellas on the beach and we continuously ran out of chairs on the beach and the pool deck.  By charging for the umbrellas we severely reduced this issue from occurring.  In your review you mentioned that your husband serves in the military.  Please thank him for his service from us.  We do quite a bit to show respect for our military troops.  We actually have 10 military families staying with us this week as part of the Troop Rewards Program where we give military families an all expense paid trip to the Sandpearl for 5 days and 4 nights.  We do this twice a year and this is our third year of doing this.  Again, thank you for taking the time to write the review.  If you would like to speak personally regarding your stay, please do not hesitate to let me know by contacting me directly at the resort.

From the moment you walk into the lobby-and are offered a glass of champagne-to the nightly ringing of the bell at sunset-everything about this place makes you feel relaxed and special. I usually stay in one of the suites-wonderful double vanity bathrooms, large deep soaking tub, walk in shower...and stackable washer/dryers-and a wonderful kitchen area.

While we do have Sweet Sixteen, Bar Mitzvahs, Bat Mitzvahs, etc on a regular basis the issue came in regards to your desire to use our pool.  We have a very strict policy regarding this.  Pool use is only for registered guests who have overnight accommodations and the most any one room can have is 5 guests, therefore limiting the pool usage per room to a maximum of 5.  You wanted to have a party in which 20 teenagers and their accompanying chaperones would be around our pool.  Unfortunately, this we could not allow.

Also, in your review you mentioned our beach and that is was public.  That is not factual however.  The beach in front of the Sandpearl is a private beach.

I was happy to hear that you were pleased with our Concierge service and you found our property gorgeous and well maintained.    In your review you mentioned that our staff walked past you on several occasions without noticing you.  I am very sorry that happened.  We normally get great compliments on our staff friendliness and eagerness to serve but it appears that was not the case in your situation.  You also mentioned the quality of our drinks at Tate's Island Grille.  I am sorry you did not find them acceptable.  We use only quality ingredients in our drinks and in our Mojitoes we make our own simple syrup and garnish with pure Sugar Cane sticks and fresh muddled mint.  We normally get great reviews on these.  I am not sure what happened to make this case different.  You also mentioned our Beach Club.  Our Beach Club is a very controlled environment.  We only have 40 members and they are only entitled to bring one guest when they come.  There are never more than 2 or 3 beach club members around at the same time.  We did perhaps have a group in house that could have been celebrating a bit too much.  We do have security around the pool however it appears that they could have done a better job at controlling the environment.  I will share your feedback with our Director of Security.

While we did have an isolated incident one weekend several weeks ago with guests belongings being taken from our beach, that is the first time of such an offense that I am aware of.  Additionally, we do have security guards on our pool deck on Friday's through Sunday's to patrol the area but they are there to make sure that the people on the pool deck are registered guests.

I appreciate your return business but apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay.  As I am sure you are aware March is our prime time of the year and the availability of rooms does become difficult.  This holds true for both upgrades and late check outs.  We do our absolute best to upgrade all guests when it is possible however due to our high occupancy in March guests have already booked the different room types so upgrading is not always available.  The same holds true with late check outs.  As you know, we have many guests that want to check in as early as possible and our check in for new guests is 4pm.  It becomes difficult to allow guests late check outs due to the amount of time that is required to ready the room for the new guests.    In your review you commented that you wrote me.  I apologize but I do not recall receiving the letter.  If you still have it and can either mail or email it to me I would appreciate it.

I was very disappointed to hear about the level of dissatisfaction you had with your time with us.  We normally have an outstanding reputation in regards to all facets of weddings that we have here.  We take much pride in making sure that we create exceptional memories for people on their special days or in this case rehearsal dinners.  In your comment you addressed the price of the event.  Events here are definately not inexpensive.  We believe however that given the normal quality of the food as well as the prime location of the event on our beautiful beach there is a high value.  I am sorry that the food you experienced was not to your liking.  I can confirm that all food is prepared immediately before the event and does not sit around for extended periods of time.  This goes for both the hamburgers and chicken wings.  I will review your comments with our Banquet Manager regarding the food being cold and not enough sternos being used.    I will also share your comments with our Banquet Manager regarding signage, exclusivity and availability of the bartender.  I can tell you that we have at least one designated bartender per event.  If they went missing for a period of time, I am truly sorry.  Again, thank you for your feedback.  I do appreciate the time you took to let me know your thoughts.

We wouldnt use the bike but think it would be fairer to give each guest 1 bike per stay as it seems to me that is to get another 25 dollars per person if you rent out the bikes as only 1 would be free. so\u2026", "date": "June 2012", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d647702-r133510159", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Excellent Resort!

I am very sorry to hear the issues you experienced and that you left disappointed.  The resort is located on Clearwater Beach, which is an island to the west of Clearwater.  It is sourrounded on the east by Clearwater Bay and on the West the Gulf of Mexico.  Due to the location of the resort not all rooms are directly facing the Gulf of Mexico, but rather the view of the coastline to the north and south.  We do offer many rooms with Gulf Views but of course those rooms rent at  a premium.  We do feel that the price placed on any given room type or view is a great value due to the nature of the resort and location.    I am very sorry for the issues you experienced with Housekeeping as well.  We  provide extensive training to our Housekeeping Team and unfortunately it appears that someone fell short on delivering on our own expectations.  I will review your comments with our Director of Housekeeping.  I am glad that you enjoyed your time at Tate's Island Grill.

The intent of the Resort Fee is to add enhancements to your stay to make the stay even more enjoyable.  The Resort Fee includes many things however you mentioned beach chairs and bicycle rentals.  The chairs on the beach are included in the Resort Fee however the umbrellas are rentable at a fee of $25 (the umbrellas include 2 chairs) as there are a limited amount.  Additionally, we do have bicycles available for rental however included with the Resort Fee is one complimentary bike rental per day.  The Beach Club is something that we offer for our local guests.  As the pool area is private you must be a Beach Club Member to enjoy it.  We have a very limited amount of Beach Club Members (under 50) to guarantee that there is no impact on our Resort Guests.  On any given day we do not have more than a dozen members joining us.    Again, thank you for taking your time to write the review.

The internet is included in the $25 resort fee and it is not available. Their business center consists of two old computers with encryption problems and a printer.

It gives me valuable feedback that I can share with our team as well as correct any misunderstandings.  In your response you mentioned that the hotel was bought by a team of investors.  This is not accurate.  A large portion of the ownership remains the same since day one.  There are new owners involved, however they are not a team of investors.  They are a very highly respected management company that own and operate many top end resorts throughout the United States and Canada.  We have moved our retail shop into the lobby of the hotel.  This has been highly received by our guests as they no longer need to leave the hotel to purchase items.  We offer high end name brands such as Tommy Bahama, Nat Nast, Vera Bradley, Brighton and more.    You also mentioned that non-guests were walking in and out of the pool.  We do several things to guarantee that only guests utilize our pool.  When issuing towels we verify guests name and room number to make sure they are registered guests.  If a guest has a towel that is not one of ours we address the guest and ask for their room information.  If they can not provide we politely ask them to leave.  We also do not permit anyone to bring items such as beer or coolers into our pool area.  We do our very best to police these issues.  If these issues happened during your stay with us I am very sorry.  I will address each item with the team.  Again, I thank you for taking the time to write your review.

These are generally upscale families who watch over their children with an eagle eye, but the kids ae there.  We are empty nesters and had an undisturbed stay in a room towards the end of the hall on an upper floor. We didn't mind the families down at the pool since we knew what to expect. Everyone knows this resort isn't cheap, but be prepared; the umbrellas (each with two beach chairs) that the resort sets out are (IIRC) $25/day.

While I appreciate the positive aspects of the resort that you mentioned I was disappointed to learn that you were not happy with our resolution to the issue you encountered during our aerial photo shoot.  For that I am very sorry.    We scheduled the event during the slowest week of the year up to that date.  We also tried to communicate to all of our guests what exactly was going to occur during the photo shoot by distrubuting letters under all guestroom doors on two different occasions leading up to the day of the shoot.  To limit the impact of having our pool unavailable from 1:00 to 2:30 we offered a complimentary bbq buffet on the adjacent beach along with complimentary beer and wine.  In the event that guests wanted a pool rather than joining us for the bbq we made accomodations with the Condo buidling next to us for our guests to use their pool.  Only 1 or 2 families ended up using that pool.   As you can imagine it is very difficult to schedule an event like this without it having an effect on guests.  It is however very necessary for our business to stay competitive and provide modern and up to date pictures of our property for marketing and internet needs.  We will take your comments into consideration for future events should it be necessary.  If you would like to speak personally regarding this experience and feel it appropriate, please call me at the hotel.  I look forward to speaking with you.

I cannot praise this hotel enough. It is not cheap but it was worth every penny. I have stayed a few times in the past at various Clearwater Beach hotels, and this time it was a toss up between the latest two hotels, the Hyatt Regency or the Sandpearl, and boy i'm i glad i picked the latter.

The beach is amazing, and you can also just spend your day there weather permitting.

Everything is a tad pricey hear but no different from any property of this caliber anywhere in the states.

The room and furnishings were beautiful and it was nice to have everything new. A few items in the room were not complete though. The closet door to the washer & dryer was hard to open and close because the door had not been installed properly and was missing screws.
