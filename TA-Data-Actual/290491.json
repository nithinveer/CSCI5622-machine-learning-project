[{"title": "Not bad could do a lot better", "review": "Stayed for a week in October with friend. Requested a room on high floor which we got. Room spacious with lovely bed , as previously mentioned very little space for toiletries in bathroom, same for clothes and underwear in main room.  Food was good on the whole, with a good choice of different courses. Hotel clean and staff always working very hard. Could do with a other bar , only one they had was a beach bar , which really not suitable for Evening drinks. Hotel is close to beach and shops. At the time we stayed there were very noisy guests !! And caused distress to those nearby. In fact credit to the hotel they were asked to leave , which they did. Be careful when booking your room , go for one overlooking mountains and not bar and swimming pool area. Nearby are all night bars and I was told rave parties on a spare piece of land nearby the hotel. On a Friday and Saturday night. Would not stay here again , I expect more of a adult only , all inclusive  hotel. \u2026", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580312-d290491-r726745553", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Excellent hotel, wonderful holiday", "review": "Just back from a week at the Alua Soul with my partner and his mother and we all had a wonderful time.  Hotel is about 30 mins from Palma airport by private transfer (definitely recommended).  Greeted with a glass of cava before heading to our rooms.  The rooms are lovely, the bed is huge and sooo comfy!  The air con in the room wasn't amazing but was good enough for us but think it would struggle to be cool enough if it gets any hotter.   We were al inclusive and extremely impressed with all the meals we ate at the hotel, never had a problem finding a table and the food was always being replenished and hot, with fish and meet cooked infant of you - delicious.  The staff in the main restaurant were always chatty and friendly.  First time in a very long time I've stayed at a hotel in peak season when we've not had to rush to get a bed, intact you could come down at lunchtime and still get a bed with an umbrella - unheard of.    The entertainment team, Alberto and Gian Luca, were just lovely, organising things for everyone all day and evening long.  I would say the evening entertainment wasn't my cup of tea but I think I was one of the minority as it was always busy.    Drinks were great in all inclusive, note that you can only have spirits from the bottom shelf but also we weren't aware until half way through the holiday that they had premium brands such as smirnoff and bacardi under the counter that were also available so if youre not offered these, go ahead and ask.    I would definitely stay again and would certainly recommend.\u2026", "date": "July 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580312-d290491-r690397811", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Average 4 star hotel", "review": "Hi Clare,  thank you for choosing us and for the time taken sharing your opinion.

The weather was warm and sunny for the majority of 7 days. This adults only hotel is conveniently located in the busy Alc\u00fadia resort, 5 mins walk from the beautiful beach, the shops are even nearer and the Old Town is within 25 mins walking distance. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. Staff in all areas of the hotel were very friendly.  We were checked in efficiently and courteously by the lovely Kylie. Our room was on floor 4 with an inland  and pool view. It was warm and sunny in the afternoon.  The room we had was of an adequate size. It was as you would expect for the refurbished rooms in hotel chains these days. Minimalistic furniture, white plastic.... Lovely lighting, good air conditioning, sufficient sockets.  There was very little area in the refurbished bathroom to store my toiletries and cosmetics. The rain shower was very powerful and there were several incidents of flooding due to the short length shower screen. There was a magnifying mirror and a hair dryer too. There was no replenishment of toiletries.  The main bedroom had beautiful comfy beds, a big, wall hung, flat screen tv, tea and coffee making facilities. I tried to use the coffee making machine but there were no instructions so I packed it away. There was a bedside digital alarm clock with huge numbers. The light was so bright from it that we had to cover it up at bedtime! There was only one closed drawer within the wardrobe unit, very inadequate. I like to keep my undergarments and certain other things private. I had to share with my husband. There were no doors to the wardrobe which contained the cooler and a very easy to use safe which was chargeable. The air conditioning was very efficient.  The balcony was adequate, 2 chairs and a low table with a drying rack. I had emailed the hotel to ascertain whether men needed to wear long trousers for dinner. I was advised that this was the rule. We packed evening wear according to this rule and was very surprised to see other guests wearing, shorts, cut off denim shorts, you name it... The restaurant was more like a canteen to be honest. I felt very over dressed at times. Some of the food was poorly cooked and some items of poor quality. For the first 3 days the 4 breakfast cereal dispensers provided  a choice of 2 containing chocolate bite size shredded wheat, one had chocolate Rice Krispies the other plain Rice Krispies. I have stayed in many 4 star Spanish hotels and the choice was poor. There were no dried fruit or nuts, no cava at breakfast. The variety of breads improved as the week went on. The pool was supervised, clean and cool but it was lovely to swim in. We made use of the pool towels for which you need to pay a deposit at reception. Our room was situated directly above the area which was used for the evening entertainment. It was extremely loud and apart from a couple of singers not to our taste. In all the hotels I have stayed in, I have never stayed in one without an indoor bar, very casual for a four star hotel.  The menu for the a la carte restaurant was the same for the 7 nights we stayed, I\u2019m not a big meat eater, didn\u2019t fancy the choices and we gave it a miss.  All in all we had a lovely holiday. The staff who never seem to have time off are a credit to the hotel. My view is that costs are being kept to a minimum which reflects in the lack of little luxuries you would expect to find in an adults only four star hotel.\u2026", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580312-d290491-r724473335", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Majorca holiday", "review": "Enjoyed a week at this adults only hotel.

Music pretty woeful and perhaps an over-dominance of space of cafe style tables and seats. Activities not my thing on a holiday but others seemed to appreciate them.  4 beds per umbrella arrangement is odd and hard to get collective agreement on.   Food and drink - definitely cutting corners. No full range of cereal for three days. No fresh juice any day. Meat largely like boot leather. Tasteless desserts. Ice cream runs out.

I'll start with the bad!  - We stayed half board but found out that there would be no drinks included. None. You only get one bottle for free as a welcome to the resort. Not only that, but the drinks are incredibly over priced in the hotel. Worst being \u20ac12 for a single Bacardi and Coke. I don't think I've ever come across a more over-priced drink anywhere in the world (and I've been to many places on many continents!). I would advise stocking your mini fridge with bottled water and cans of soft drinks from the local LIDL.  - Breakfast is OK but dinner is pretty awful. And I'm not usually one to complain about food.

It is clear that as it is newly renovated, there were a few teething problems (toilet not fixed to the wall in spa) and some minor renovations still being done however, we did not let this affect our holiday.   The food in the restaurant was great with a wide variety being provided each day.  It was always hot and the waiting staff were very attentive.  The only thing we felt let it down was the fact that all drinks had to be paid\u2026", "date": "May 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580312-d290491-r490166849", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Good hotel, but not quite ready....", "review": "Dear emma051188, Thank you for your feedback, we are happy to hear you had an enjoyable holiday.

We had a superior room with breakfast only.   Cons:  We were met by friendly people at the front desk upon check-in. When we came up to our room we quickly noticed that there were some pipes missing from our sink. We went to wash our hands and the water came splashing at us. This happened because the pipe connecting the sink to the wall was missing.  We informed the front desk as soon as we saw this, but since it was midnight and no other superior rooms available at that time, we had to stay the night in a regular room for 1 night, which didn't really bother me and my boyfriend, so we were fine with it. The next day they had fixed the sink in our previous room so we moved to that room again.

I knew that it was a newly refurbished hotel and many people complained about building works and noise etc. We arrived on 18/05 and had a warm welcome at reception. -we were told to pay a tourist tax, which I was not aware of but the receptionist said Thomson should have informed us, which of course they didn't!
