The hotel was in a perfect position, not to close to all the mass hotel complexes nearer the beach but close enough to make the short walk to both the miles of sandy beach and the picturesque port. A short walk to the old town of Alcudia with its lovely old city wall added yet another bonus to the hotel.  We had a room overlooked the gardens which were beautifully maintained and meant the room was fairly quite compared to the rooms overlooking the pools. The room was spacious, clean and well maintained with spacious balconies.  The restaurant was well managed with a huge selection of high quality food at all times. One downside was one chef who want to act like a clown most of the time and appear to be unable to crack an egg without breaking the yolk or make an omelette without burning it. Thankfully he could be avoided by not choosing the eggs on those days.  The entertainment was a good standard and well managed.  The pools were lovely and the children had a lovely time playing with the bubble. We had no children with us but we took great pleasure in watching the children so happy with both the water and also the staff entertainment put on for them. As a couple with no children we took advantage of the adult only area and had many relaxing hours there enjoying the peace both in the area and in the pool. Perfect!  We even managed to hire the bikes at the hotel to cycle to the natural park nearby. The bikes were a bit old but totally adequate for casual cycling,  I guess they are not  used much so understandably not top quality.   The staff were all so friendly and made us feel welcome and coped with everything in a professional way. We thanks you for your care and attention and would not hesitate   to recommend the hotel to anyone.\u2026", "date": "September 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580312-d316297-r712822082", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Second fantastic stay.

We are sorry to read your experience wasn't as good as previous years due to the temperature of our hot tubs and pools. Due to new Health & Safety regulations, this year the maximum temperature permitted is 36 degrees. Most guests are generally ok with this temperature, but we understand each person has a different perception. I hope this explains the difference with previous years, and I am sorry you were disappointed because of this.  I also regret you left with the impression our team didn't take your case seriously, our engineers checked the hot tub inmediately after you reported the issue and they didn't find any faulty pieces. The engineer usually leaves a confirmation note in the terrace which I'm guessing for some reason it wasn't there.  Our goal is that our guests enjoy a perfect holiday, and I am sorry that you left our hotel with a bad impression of our service due to this particular incident.   I am very grateful to you for your trust in Zafiro Hotels and, once again, for having taken the time to share your experience with the rest of the travel community.

We are sorry to hear that your daughter had an ear infection during your holiday, I appreciate how inconvenient and unfortunate this can be and we all hope she\u2019s fully recovered by now.   We take Health & Safety accusations very seriously and I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that our engineers check daily the water of our pools.

In the event of finding anything suspicious, we have strict protocols to guarantee the safety of all our guests. We carried an internal investigation immediately after you reported this and we\u2019ve failed to find evidence of any bacteria in the water.   I have however shared your feedback with both our engineers and this company to keep a closer eye and be extra careful with the water readings.   Should you be interested in reading the water parameters over the period of your stay, we remain at your entire disposal.

Only problem I have is the cleaning of the rooms wasn\u2019t great the maids should need more time in each room. We had a problem with ants everywhere my daughter thought it was fun to stamp the ants every day because I gave her a Euro for each one she killed. But they were like SAS ants and wouldn\u2019t die.

We booked a studio for our small family of 3 which was basically a double room with a small single bed next to a double bed and a small kitchenette unit with fridge and hob. It was perfect for what we needed, a good size and we didn't miss having a lounge area at all as we were hardly there and there was the balcony to relax on when our daughter was in bed. The room was cleaned daily, even on the days when they said it wouldn't be cleaned so it always felt fresh.

We are sorry to hear that you were unable to enjoy your holidays as wished for.

We would like to mention that a few factors such as being close to the coastline, having vegetated natural ponds nearby and temperature changes are the ideal habitat for mosquitos.   We believe that tranquility and being able to relax is one of the most important things for our guests; if we would have received the information about the noise in the surrounding rooms  we would have taken the measurements needed to reduce the noisiness , though we like to mention that changing rooms to solve the inconvenience  was not possible at the time as being fully booked due to the international event of the Iron man.

In some months we have about 30% of the rooms occupied by repeaters guests.  Concerning the guest who was in our hotel, we do not understand that, if it is true that they did not like neither the hotel nor Puerto Alcudia itself, why they did not ask their touroperator representative, to change into another zone in Mallorca.  Concerning the entertainment, there is information about it at the reception, as there are some big boards at the wall with the schedule of all activities organised for every day at every time, for miniclub, teenagers or adults. All the shows displayed in the hotel (by our own entertainers, by our flying team between Viva Hotels or by external professional shows) have a great response from the guests, who are very enthusiastic.  About the photos in the brochure, it is shown the lower building, but this does not imply that all the rooms are going to be there. If they would have asked to have a room in the small building, perhaps they could have had one there. On the other side, for example, nothing is said that the rooms equipment is much better than expected, as all rooms have been fully renovated after brochures were done.  Concerning the bar service and room cleaning, it happens exactly the same as said before:  every fifteen days an external enterprise (which does not belong to Viva Hotels) comes to all hotels and make lots of questions to the guests, about the departments service, food, equipment, etc. We can show at any time that we have always very good results coming from opinions from the guests.  Related to Alcudia itself, and specially to hotel Viva Tropic, this one is located near the harbour (only 5 minutes away walking), and only 2 minutes away from the beach. In Puerto de Alcudia there are lots of differents restaurants, which suit to all differents money levels, from fast food restaurants to extremely distinguished famous restaurants.  About the beach, we should only say that most beaches have the \u201cblue flag\u201d, international award not given by us, but by the European Community, done following very stricted rules concerning the water, sand, environment, first aid services, etc.  To sum up, and as it is shown in the enclosed graphics about the satisfaction from our guests in the hotel, there are many reasons to consider that almost all people are very satisfied with their holidays in our hotel and with Puerto Alcudia. We do not know all reasons for the disappointment, but what is sure, is that our staff always do their best to hear the guests reasons, give full explanations and help looking for a good and quick solution or response.  All the staff, as always, will be waiting for guests coming here, to offer them the best choice to enjoy their special holidays.   THIS IS OUR MAIN GOAL.

During the day we never spent time by the hotel poolside, simply venturing on down to Alcudia beach where the sand is pure white and very wide. The Sea is also pretty shallow a long way out, so great for a family to use.
