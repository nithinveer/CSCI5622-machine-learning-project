[{"title": "Just be prepared. Read this review", "review": "I normally read a number of reviews before I start tapping away. Of those I read, although some good points I feel clarification is in order.  OK main point, very important. This is not all inclusive, at best it's full board with some free drinks for 12 hours. 11am to 11pm. Outside of these times you need to pay for anything, including coffee and water. Get used to this and it will be ok.  Meals:  The hotel is predominantly Spanish occupation. So the menu choices at the buffet are probably different to what you expected. The food is edible and varied but you need to be prepared to experiment. You won't see a lot of English cuisine. Breakfast is not great and the choices limited and often colder than required. But you can eat cold meats, cheese, yogurt and pastries. Plenty of fruit available. They need to up their game here a bit. But if your prepared is ok.  Pool: Not for children, no shallow end. No diving or jumping or any horseplay Very strict not much fun.  Entertainment: Same problem and the food. It's geared around local tastes.  Now very odd. They have various entertainment such as bingo, dance class and karaoke. Bingo you play for a small necklace about 2 Euro and a cocktail you must drink there and then.  Board games, now this is a puzzler.  You have a selection of board games but.....you can not play them in the  bar, you must go elsewhere. Very strange. But if you accept this it's ok.  Now the overall bit. The hotel is clean. The rooms are clean and well kept. The staff can be a little grumpy so what. They are working your not. WiFi.... forget it and don't pay for it. It's very poor.  Location. 20 mins walk from anywhere and a LOT of hills. But taxis are cheap and very quick to come.  It's a cheap holiday in a back street. It's not horrible and if you accept the way things are you will have a decent time  Is it a 3 star hotel.  No I have stayed in better 2 star. Is that a problem. No.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187481-d529061-r728394138", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Catering and No Hospitality..", "review": "Dear guest.

In that spirit, upon entering the Hotel Perla you are given you're room key, hotel information and a welcome note.   THAT note was the most welcome we felt our entire stay.   We were constantly looked down on by the elderly guests the entire time. Had we known younger guests weren't wanted at the hotel we would have booked elsewhere but there was no information to state this. All but two of the staff members were miserable. The nice ones being the bartender Diego and the lifeguard James. The other staff were awful though, in particular one of the other barmen who's name no one would ever give me and sadly the only way I can describe him is bald and rotund.  He was always looking at us as if we were something he stepped on, constantly making us feel like were a nuisance just for asking for a coffee (which takes about four seconds to make) and even going so far as to talk s*** about us right Infront of us. He assumed we spoke no Spanish. He was wrong! But the most insulted we felt is when he mocked us for saying gracias each time he served us. I apologise but my mother raised me with manners. He shook his head at us and said \"gracias, always gracias\" which may be confusing to read but in the context of the moment it was clearly a dig. Hi is without doubt the worst employee there.  I understand that they may not be used to having seven men all staying together. All of varying ages but it was my cousin's 21st birthday and so we came to this beautiful island to make the day special for him.  We realised early on that the younger members of the group required some looking after and so to appease the other guests we made sure each time we went to the bar we went outside and sat right down at the bottom, past the pool where no one else sat just so we were out the way.  The music was dated and very loud and is more catered to dancing in groups. So in our little corner we put our own music on and being Brits we like a good sing along. This just led to more dirty looks. EVEN on the nights when just two of us would go up and have a friendly game of pool (they were actually snooker balls on a pool table but that's neither here nor there) we were still treated like crap.   The worst part is we were unaware of the hotel's feelings about us because nobody said anything to us until day six when another British guest approached us and said that they had approached him and asked him to ask us to keep it down. At the time they asked him, he refused to do so as he was just one man with his wife and we were seven men and while I'll argue that we are in no way intimidating, neither are we particularly small. It was not his responsibility to talk to us. That lies solely with the hotel!  I don't want to go on too much longer but to sum up:  From our experience The Hotel Perla has 'ok' catering but it's hospitality is practically none existent.   The food is varied but the temperature is all over the place and there's not really anything that can be made into a meal. It's just random.  The same applies to the house keeping. My room was serviced every day and by that I mean they made the bed and closed the curtains. That was the extent of it. But my cousin's room next to mine wasn't serviced once despite having the please service sign on the door the whole time.  I've worked in the catering and hospitality sector for years now and I would never dream of treating anyone the way we were treated. Everyone has bad days but it's called putting on a happy face.   I will definitely come to the beautiful canary islands again but I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THE HOTEL PERLA!

I\u2019m going to be as honest as possible. What everyone needs to remember about Hotel Perla is that it\u2019s only a 3 star hotel and is very competitively priced! The rooms are basic with a small ceiling fan which would probably be not cool enough in high season but adequate for November. Maid service was daily and cleaned to a very high standard. Beds were comfortable and there was a fridge in the room. No tea, coffee or kettle but that didn\u2019t bother me. We were on floor 5 which was perfect, I would recommend asking for a high floor. Breakfast, lunch and evening meals were all really nice! A great selection so you would have to be really picky not to find anything to eat. Kitchen staff and waiters/waitresses were all really friendly (some other guests were quite miserable but hey that happens everywhere) the hotel had mainly German , Spanish, Dutch guests. Not many English at all but again that suited me. There is nothing here for children but again that was another plus point! The main thing that lets this hotel down was poor entertainment but apart from that we had a lovely stay. Barman Pablo was excellent and always happy to help!

The food was good and the menu was varied. The room was small and not to the standard portrayed in the pictures on their website. The bed was very uncomfortable and would recommend going all inclusive to allow you enough drinks to overcome this issue. If you are hoping for a peaceful break this is probably not the hotel for you as it has very thin walls and very noisy cleaners. This hotel would benefit some money being spent upgrading the facilities in the rooms to bring it back to the 3 stars it advertises.  To no fault of the hotel Northern Tenerife does suffer with a lot of cloudy days even when the South is basking in Sunshine.", "date": "July 2011", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187481-d529061-r116065243", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "We liked it, but would not go back!!", "review": "Hotel was fine, a few faults (no a/c in the bedrooms) but on the whole the staff were very attentive.
