[{"title": "Diane", "review": "Spent 2 weeks here, it was very clean, beds comfortable and everything you needed for shelf catering. We booked sea view room but we're not happy with view as sea view was to side our direct view was of back of restaurants and car park. We asked for upgrade they only had 1 other which was on level 1 which balcony was level with restaurant roof and extra e20 a night I don't think so.. My advice when choosing room types go for pool view and you get it all. Safes here are at reception which I think is good Idea e36 for 2 weeks and you get e6 back. Pool bar excellent good food and good price usually these are expensive and not up to much but not here. The private beach is a SMALL PEBBLE BEACH main beach is about 15 minutes walk. Never a problem with sunbeds for the whole of the holiday although there were quite a lot of broken ones but we were there the last 2 weeks of season.

You can ask reception for a key to use the sauna, although they want you to pay extra cash and for very short use of it.
