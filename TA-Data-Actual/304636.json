There were good sides to this hotel so let me start with the positive: The beach always has free sunbathing beds so there is space and you can choose. There are beach bars with drinks and coffee throughout the day. There are a few people from the staff that are actually nice and the evening programme is not that bed. City centre is close and cheap to get to by dolmos (1euro per person) Now the negative: First situation: We get a pamflet where it says at what time is each meal and we get down around 18:55 at the main restaurant (pamflet says dinner 18:45) so we say super we\u2026", "date": "July 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d304636-r695297284", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 3}, {"title": "All inclusive ", "review": "On behalf of Turquoise Hotel family, we would like to express our sincere gratitude for choosing our property for your stay.

The reason why this hotel stands out from the rest is due to the outstanding service from the staff who are always there with a smile and happy to be doing their jobs. I believe this is due to management looking after their staff. Keep it up!!! This makes your hotel extra special.  The Turkish bath is a must with the Bali girls who were excellent along with all the food staff, reception staff, bar staff etc. The hotel was spotless and even management helped out cleaning in the restaurant.

The hotel is out of the way, but it is a short and very cheap bus ride into town which is lovely to have a walk about (And also try and traditional kebab - Cheap and SO tasty!) and have a cup of coffee in the sunshine. There are some beautiful ruins at the end of the street which are a must see also. We went on 2 trips booked through the thompson holiday rep. The turkish spa which is a must! And the day trip to see the hostorical sights of Antayla. Again a very good and inofrmative trip that was worth the money. The pools are well kept as is the small beach and the decking area.

Arrived at the Turquoise hotel approx. 4.00am. On arrival the reception was good and a sandwich with drinks were waiting in the room.  The food at the hotel is excellent from breakfast to late bites at midnight. Staff are very friendly, although English is spoken it is very busy with Russian & German tourists. Plently of entertainments during the day & shows in the evening.  The rooms are suitable but a little dated, but have everything you need.Set in 35 acres of pine forests,the peace & tranquility is great. The beach & pools are fantastic.Plenty for children to do aswell.  Side is very close a dolmus (local bus) can be flagged down outside the main entrance to the hotel cost 3 turkish lire\u2026", "date": "August 2005", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d304636-r3906210", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Superb Holiday", "review": "We spent the last week of August at this hotel and loved it.  Food superb, hotel superb (very clean and efficient).  We liked the fact that there were hardly any English and that it wasn't like being in Benidorm.  Germans did not bother us at all.  Yes you have to fight to get a sunbed but breakfast finished at 10 so you had to be up for that anyway!!  We loved it so much, we only left the complex once and plan to go back next year!!

Food was excellent, staff very very friendly and facilities first class. Normal problems of towels on sunbeds early in the morning but only a slight hiccup. If someone has a sweet tooth then go there as the deserts were out of this world-easy to put weight on! Located in huge pine forest 2 miles from the town of side. Taxis to Side only 6 euros each way. Roman remains there well worth a visit. If you like drinking all day then that is not a problem as one bar is open 24 hrs. One good thing is at mealtimes you can order bottles of wine rather than glasses-of course all included. Weather was  hot -in the 40's each day. Spa is good with sauna small gym and steamroom free. All in all well worth trying out and we hope to go there again\u2026", "date": "August 2005", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d304636-r3754708", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}]
