No fruits, because melon is a vegetable. Unhelpful Staff, horrible behaviour. Restaurant was dirty as well. No cutlery, no plates. I was so disappointed and not feeling well after this food.

So what is it inside? We are a couple of students from Russia, stayed here for 11 days in july 2016. Advantages: Quite normal animation for 3* hotel, but the head animator did'nt know russian or at least english.  Guys on reception were wonderful, they always try to do their best. And maybe the beach. Mention - NOT THE SEA! Finally, that's all  Disadvantages: Rooms are outdated at all, TV did'nt work still the maintenace changet it physically (not repaired, just changed the tv box), There were a number of insects in the room. Spidets, Ants. View on the village and desert feels not very comfortable, also for 3* hotel.

Anyway you'll not spend you time in the room:) perfect beach and nice sweeming pool just next to the hotel building.

Communication at the reception is very poor - you must be French tourists to get prepaid room, otherwise you get noisy pool-view or ground floor. The dining room looked like a canteen - trays and long lines for food. Although the food (chicken, lamb, beef) used to be tasty, but it was full of finely chopped bones, so it was not eatable. Thankfully there were pasta and vegetables. Pool bar was for fun - 3 tables with 10 robust iron-chairs, flies and re-washed disposable cups. Ugh. Disgust.  The beach was the only nice place, but only till came seaweed. Five meters wide black and smelly carpet remained lying there more days.
