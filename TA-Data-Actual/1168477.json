First 2 mornings room was cleaned as you would expect, pjs folded , glasses washed, after that bed just made and bin half emptied. Attitude of staff so arrogant- one day at 5 am and enquired if I could have some breakfast to take out , told \u201cno\u201d rather abruptly, no sorry we can\u2019t do that, just no!  Majority of the fruits at breakfast were so overripe (apples all wrinkly, bananas all black) only good for baking.  Vending machine for hot drinks - water wasn\u2019t hot enough to make tea, being a Brit, I like a cup of tea.  Had a meal in the bar/cafeteria one evening and had to wait almost 30 minutes, apart from that the service was good and food hot.

Well now, let's look at this hotel with the benefit of the healing quality of time. The weather in Alicante at the time Late April 13, was pretty awful and unseasonal, We did have a few sunny but windy days.  On arrival we were delighted to see our old friend Mr Chumley Warner on reception, much bustling and hustling saw us get into our rather bleak room. This is a 3 star hotel in a potentially 4* location. Room was clean, quiet and view over west side as all the rooms are. Staff I must mention were generally very good, most of the waitresses also.
