Storage was quite limited though and I think if you stayed for a week, you'd struggle a bit but for 3 nights, it was fine. The bathroom was great with a fab shower and there were loads and I mean loads of different toiletries provided.

Overall it is pretty clean hotel, I would give it a 4.5 of 5 points for that. Rooms are little small for our taste, it would be better if they were bigger just for comfort but as I said, it still was a great stay. Don't expect a big pool, it's not for swimming I would say, but just to chill or cool down. Staff was helpful now and there, but sometimes it wasn't the best service you could get.
