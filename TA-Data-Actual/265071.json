I stayed in this hotel for 3 days and 2 nights and I just remembered that I left behind a couple of things. I emailed them about this and was glad to hear back immediately. They were able to find the two things I left and they kept it as is.  Since they kept my things sorted even after 2 days from my check out, I mentioned to reward them but they declined.

All previous comments about the breakfast are good and we offer American Breakfast to all our clientele ( which is not common in Italy in hotels of our category). - Every week, or as  needed, we  paint the walls of the rooms. In Italy, a three star hotel, is not obliged to have mini bar in the room and for this you have found vending machine , not in the corridor, but at the exit of the elevator.

You write about bed bugs but there weren't any of them. Have you never seen them? Or have you just heard about ? When you talked about the problem to the Receptionist, you were immediately given another room; I personally checked the former room and I haven't not found any bed bug. It is untrue that the Hotel is as dirty as you say: rooms are simple but respectable. It is untrue that the website shows only rooms located on the 5th Floor: there are pictures both of standard and superior rooms as well as of Self catering Apartments. When you surf on internet through websites about our hotel, you should pay more attention to what you are looking at.  It is false that the Staff is as you describe it: you should give yourself full attention as well to the reviews we have received from our guests. Lastly it is absolutely untrue that we don't serve fresh croissants: you have never had your breakfast. As I already said, we are very disappointed about your review; do enable me to say that it is incorrect that you could write you did.

Unfortunately works have been heavy in the last week of january exactly because everything should be ready very soon. On March 1st there will be the opening of the new tram service which will bring a modern, fast and silent service connecting the centre of the city to the suburbs. This work will serve all new lines connecting also to the airport soon. I thank you for the nice words against our hotel and, as General Manager, I can assure there will be no more sounds. I have to say works starts at 8.00 in the morning and not at 6.30 and also our reception desk will be able to provide inside rooms (we dispose of a large number)) for all those clients which the may encountered problems in these last few days of the construction. I will post a picture on Tripadvisor next week in order to show the status of work which are really nearly to the end.

As you may learn from other reviews we encoutered a problem which caused a big damage on air conditioned system on the 4th and 5th floor of the hotel and we apologize for that.  All your comments are very interesting and we wish to clarify a few fact, which may help other guests in judging the hotel.  - The fact we do not have minibars is a choice. On the 1st, 3rd and 5th floore there are distribution machines for beverages and snacks. In a three star hotel is not compulsory to have minibars, and we trust a distribution machine is better for clients (which then will not have to pay ridicolous fees for beverages from the minibar). - It's the first complain we get about it and the rest of our clientele just love it. - Regarding Milk temperature I have to point out that we have three bottles of milk on the buffet, two colds and one at normal temperature. It has happend in the past a few clients were asking for milk at normal temperature, especially for the children. - We will anyway accept your suggestion and have a sign to indicate the temperature in the different bottles. - Finally fresh fruit. The standards for a three star hotel (a budget property like we are) do not include fruit. Our breakfast is considered much above expectactions from the majoirity of our guests. For instance you will not find many three stars in Italy offering eggs. Anyway, in order to cover the problem and considering that people would rather prefer a fruit instead of a croissant in very hot periods, the management has decided to include apples and peaches for the period June/July/August.

Upon arrival by train we were able to locate the hotel by following directions from a prior posting.  We were in room 426 and it was better than we expected.  We had a balcony that had a nice view of the hills above Florence and it was nice to be able to leave the door open during the night.  Be sure and keep the curtains closed cause we did get a couple of mosquitoes in the room.
