Only when Police claim us to show them recorded images, then we show them.  Therefore, most of the comments you write here are FALSE. We never showed you any image, so we understand that you imagined or invented all the information written down.  You think you lost a handbag (with 600 \u20ac in it), you think someone stole your handbag from the restaurant, and, in addition, you think that the handbag was stolen by one of our staff.  As I told you when you explained me the situation on Wednesday, first of all (what most of the people do, indeed) I told you to go to the police station and write a police report. That is the initial step, so that we can continue our investigation. We asked the 3 people that were working on that day, and no one (even the Restaurante Supervisor) saw any handbag during your breakfast time.  After that, I personally checked our recorded images, but our cameras are not in the restaurant area... There is only one camera in the cafeteria, but not int the restaurant. So, I couldn't see anything.  On Thursday, we talked again. I ask you about the police report, but you decided not to go to the police station, even when I explained how to go there (because the police don't come to the hotel for  those sort of situations), the way to fill out the claim, etc.  You told me that, probably in the afternoon, you would go there.  On Friday, again, I asked you about the police report. And again, for any mysterious and suspicious reason, you didn't go to the police station, which is the only thing I needed so that we continue with our investigation and talk to our insurance department.    Could someone tell us why a person who guarantee that someone in the staff stole a handbag with a lot of money, don't go to the police station and write a claim???  It's so dificult???   I explanied you many many times the procedure in order to clarify the situation, but it seems you didn't want to clarify it, according to your behaviour.   On the other hand, the feedback I had from you on Friday was a THREAT to publish a comment on Tripadvisor if we didn't refund the 600 \u20ac \u2026.   Just one word:  BLACKMAIL   From my point of view, we did our best to help you and show you how to proceed with the investigation. You did nothing.  We invited you to some drinks in the cafeteria, not as a compensation of the SUPPOSED stolen handbag, but for trying to be  polite for the bad experience you were filling.  We are really sorry for your lost/stolen handbag. But it is very serious to accuse someone without evidences, and even more to announce it in public.    In conclusion, we take the opportunity to inform to our customers that we work hardly everyday to give the best service as possible, in the best secure environment we can.
