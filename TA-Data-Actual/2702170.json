[{"title": "Great location for everything!", "review": "We rented a condo at Runaway Beach Club via an owners website and were delighted with the accommodation. Very spacious condo overlooking the lake, two pools, spa and gym met our needs perfectly after dealing with the crowds all day at the parks!

The fact that we stayed in a ground floor condo did mean we had a bit of noise from the upstairs but not enough to worry about.

I received confirmation emails w/ details for 9 other people's reservations. Our confirmation voucher was for a 2 bedroom condo when we booked a 3 bedroom. They didn't have any available so 1 person had to sleep in the living room. Gate code was wrong so we had to wait for someone else to enter. I will admit, the area was great. The buildings are very cute & outdoor maintenance was excellent. The old saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" applies here! Those are the only good things I can say about this place. Had it been a 2 star hotel at about $100 a night- it would have been exactly what we expected. But this place was over $200 a night w/ an additional $150 resort & cleaning fees for a 3 day stay so we expected much better. I took 52 pictures of all the stained walls, carpets, shower curtains & furniture, broken drawers, dirty tubs & oven, bugs adhered to range hood, missing knobs & towel bars, dented & stained fridge, broken dishes & more! There were 3 TVs w/ 1 remote and the TV's didn't even work. We went to plug 1 in and found an outlet hanging out of the wall with no cover. The mattresses were very old & lumpy and wreaked havoc on our backs. Lots of rust in the tub. There is no office at this hotel so there is no one you can report to. I called the hotel number several times. It rings over 20 times then says leave a message. I left 4 messages & no one ever came by or called back. We left after only 1 day there.

The Villa was $52 a night so as you can imagine we were a bit leary.  The villa was HUGE and it was CLEAN.  2 Bedrooms, 2 full baths.  Kitchen area, full size washer and dryer, which my daughter has contact dermatitis, so I went to Wal Mart which is accross the street and bought the detergent we use and washed the sheets for her. We stayed for the week and went to Disney.  We used the pool almost every day.  The area was very clean as well.  The property was very very quiet.  They were renovating some of the units near us, but the construction did not interfere at all. I would recommend this to anyone and plan on returning.

The condo was very clean and well cared for. Housekeeping added personal touches to make our room warm and inviting. We didn't use the pool or the fitness center but walked around them and the facilities looked superb. My kids loved the cookies in the lobby. I didn't feel threatened at all going to and from my car in this gated community. We walked to the nearby al-Mart and restaurants. I also loved having the microwave and fridge.

The previous company relocated to an offsite location and still rents units to some customers. Unfortunately, when a company is no longer operating the services of the resort, is not able to fulfill all the promises and services as advertised. This has caused a lot of confusion not only for their guests but our future guests as well. Perhaps most distressing of all are the guests of the older company who have bad experiences. We empathize with those guests and hope that when they return, that they will stay at Runaway Beach Club through the new onsite management and be able to enjoy a much better stay. Since Charlestowne Hotels began in March, we have been constantly working to create an outstanding experience for our guests; and would love to have an opportunity to show you the results that can come from good rental management. We are close to rolling out an indoor Caf\u00e9 Azul, where guests and owners can enjoy their favorite beverage, and order a meal while enjoying a day at the pool. There are attendants at the pool area that offer a complimentary towel service, and a new kids and guest program is beginning, and these are just some of the new amenities that are planned: Movie Night, Arts & Crafts, Hip Hop dance classes, yoga classes, aqua aerobics etc. These will be based on availability and demand. Again we are terribly distressed, that anyone\u2019s first impression of Runaway Beach Club may not be a good one; but we would like to extend a personal invitation to you to return and experience the new changes being implemented and to assure you of the best in service and hospitality at the new Runaway Beach Club. Please feel free to contact me directly; should you have any questions.
