The only minus, but independent of the hotel, is a large number of Russians who behave terribly without respecting any cultural principles. They waste food, take it to the room, take full plates and don't eat everything. They listen to music from portable speakers without paying attention to the fact that they are in a public area. They litter, dirt, and don't respect the presence of others. This does not apply to individual cases, but to the vast majority. Nevertheless, I consider a very good hotel and a very good holiday.

We found a good looking hotel with a very nice room and nice restaurant and pools. Is not a luxury hotel but it is a clean one and food was more than decent. Very good beer and we loved the beach bar and restaurant. The room was cleaned on a daily base and we had good WI Fi in the room. We traveled with 2 kids and they enjoyed the pools and the small water park. We also enjoyed the 5 minutes stroll to the beach. It was very nice to have a tourists desk opened 24/7 with very good English speakers. They were very helpful in the 1-st day and showed us everything we needed to know. i would definitely recommend this hotel for families that are looking for a peaceful holiday with a good quality for the\u2026", "date": "August 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d7910023-r408527537", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Cleanliness": 3, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 4}, {"title": "best stay home.....very bad service and very sad staff", "review": "Dear Guests,  Thank you for a nice review about our lovely hotel.See you soon,  Kind Regards, Hotel Management.", "date": "August 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d7910023-r407462449", "sub_review": {"Location": 2, "Sleep Quality": 1, "Service": 1}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Dirty hotel...

In our 7 day stay, we never saw the pool being cleaned or tested for ph, and they only washed down the pool area and sun-loungers once.   There are significantly less sun-loungers than the hotel capacity numbers, so we witnessed many arguments between other guest for sun-loungers. By 7 am, all the sun-loungers had been reserved even though the hotel supposedly doesn't allow this.  The restaurant had very little variety and by day 2 we were bored of the food. There was not enough seating for the hotel capacity, so we had to make sure we got there at opening time to avoid disappointment.
