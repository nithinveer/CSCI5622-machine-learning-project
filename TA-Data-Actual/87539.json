The two bedroom suite was very nice, clean, outstanding shower off the master bedroom, lots of space to spread out, and two balconies overlooking the beach.

We rented a 1 bedroom suite.  The bedroom had a king sized bed and a very large jacquizzi tub in the master bathroom.  My sister slept on the sofa bed in the living room and it was very comfortable.  There was also a second bathroom with a washer/dryer in the closet.  The bathrooms were stocked with plenty of towels including beach towels, blow dryer, etc.     There was a kitchen with all the modern conveniences and a dining room area with a glass dining room table.

The condo was beautiful the only down side was that there was  only one elevator working at the time but was to open the following thursday so it was fine.  The weather was  absolutely wonderful the sunsets spectacular and we did enjoy the south end of the beach better the north looks a little crowded.  For the first time at fort myers beach it  was just wonderful and yes i would go back and stay there.

I am new to Florida and wanted to look around the Ft. Myers area as a part of vacation.  Started in the Orlando area and ended on Ft. Myers Beach at the beginning of July.  I and my Fianc\u00e9 liked it so much, we immediately booked for a getaway for early November.  We enjoy the beachfront suites.  Couldn't get the sixth floor this time.  Had to settle on the third.  It was still fantastic.    Pointe Estero is on the southwest end of Ft. Myers Beach which offers less traffic and noise and a more secluded environment.  Walking the beach each morning and spending the afternoons by the pool is just what the doctor ordered.  Local dining is pleasurable.  We've already discovered our favorites.

I stayed at Sunstream`s Pointe Estero the 5th time within the last 10 years and I am sure to come again and again :-). The big beach including the powder-fine white sand at the high-rise gulffront building (full gulf view from every unit !) is one of the most beautiful I ever saw and is very clean and well maintained - ideal for small kids. It\u00b4s never overcrowded there, because most neighbor buildings are vacation condos or small motels (Outrigger/Holiday Inn nearby). The suite units are huge, fully refurbished with e.g. new carpets, partially new furniture, new kitchen appliances and nice views of the gulf and the beautiful backbay of Ft. Myers Beach.

It was cut short by Hurricane Charlie.  Our reservation was messed up and we did not have the correct room.  We booked gulf front and were given gulf view.  When we brought it to the staffs' attention we were upgraded to the penthouse.  It was great.   Our only problems were a little mold in the master bath and not much help when we were evacuated. I don't think the evacuation problems were with the staff but are a Florida problem.  No one knew what to do with the tourists.  I hope the resort survived well...we can't wait to go back!
