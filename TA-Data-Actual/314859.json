[{"title": "Lovely stay ", "review": "Arrived at the hotel at roughly midnight. We were given our room key and took by caddy to room. We paid the extra for the upgrade which is worth it WiFi is a great in room 485. We were given a map telling us where we can\u2019t go as hotel is off limits. I find that strange as we upgraded our room so we should be able to go anywhere. Air con took a while to get going, The tv has a USB port if you want to take a external hard drive it only shows bbc world news in English. Breakfast has plenty choice eggs salad veg and fruit as well as toast and croissants.  Lunch and dinner were also plentiful I can\u2019t see how anyone could say the food is boring. We tried the Turkish restaurant it was very nice but say no to the raki my boyfriend was poorly all day after it. We had exact same other than the drink.  We headed to the main pool at 9:30am the sun is making its way round. The entertainment staff are friendly and tried to include us even though we were 2 of the 6 English guests staying at hotel. More English had arrived mid week.It\u2019s was a nice touch the entertainment staff shouting over to us to check we were listening during the pool games.  The pool with slides is cool to there is no food there but they\u2019re is a drinks bar and the staff are very friendly. Note it\u2019s around 3 degrees higher at this pool as you don\u2019t get sea breeze. The evening entertainment had various shows which the Germans seemed to love which we thought was ok. On Monday and Thursdays they have a disco at the pool bar it\u2019s all over the top pyro lights and everyone is up dancing a lot of fun even if your just watching.  Outside the hotel is s bar the \u201cgolden fizz\u201d great after hours has football and entertainment on we heard a very good singer,the staff were very friendly and made us some delicious cocktails.  We ventured into side 3 Euro\u2019s on the dolomus. Taxi back was 8 Euro. We ate in side it was 49\u20ac  for two steaks and two drinks, everyone is super friendly there. We booked the dolphin cruise which was 50\u20ac it was fairly average the places they show you on leaflet looked completely different in real life, Although food was nice and foam party was a nice touch,  On the day we left we asked if we could keep our room on but unfortunately the room had it\u2019s next guest arriving. We got use of the shower room which was a room over looking the pool with slides. You had use of it for half an hour and it had towels and shower gels inside. Which is less stress for you carrying things around. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here we meet some lovely people and feel refreshed and would come again thank you melas. \u2026", "date": "September 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d314859-r709911231", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "A great big thank you", "review": "We have just got back from a 10 day stay at melas holiday village, and what a great holiday it was on arrival was meet at reception by too great guys who both spoke good English checking was easy our luggage was taken to our room up a flight of stair and put in the room then the bell man showed us how the air conditioning worked which was helpful a small tip 10 lira went down well,  the rooms are a normal size with 2 single beds put together there was also a pull out bed if needed & a good size bathroom there is plenty of storage & free safe  in the room. The rooms are very well keep and clean by the house keeping staff who also top up the free mini bar with bottled water coke and fizzy orange, tea and coffee every other day. Eating it\u2019s a all inclusive resort there is a freshly cooked food always available at all meal times some great some not so but in general we always found something and if you don\u2019t fancy going to restaurant you can eat at the pool bar at lunch time. The grounds are very kept very clean the gardens are well maintained by the many gardeners and around the pools the pool attended work hard cleans at least 4-5 time a day emptying ash trays wiping down tables and picking up used cups, one thing I would say there is a slope from the pools to the top of the resort which could be awkward with someone with a disability, pools there are 2 pools and 2 small children pools the 2 main pools are just over a metre deep and the children\u2019s one are ankle deep, there is an aqua park at the top of resort with slides which as opening time for the kids or young adults but you can still swim or sunbathe when the slides are closed. hotel staff were great can understand you and many can speak English much better then my Turkish and they can\u2019t do enough for you and most had a smile on there faces and a good morning as there walk passed, we have got to give a  mention to the animation team who work hard to insure that everyone a good time play games and the pool or playing darts, shooting etc  And a special mention to Ahmet and Ersin and Fatima who take time to get to know you and get you to join in with the fun, the resort is mainly German but that didn\u2019t matter because as I said mostly all the staff could speak English and the evening entertainment was spoken in various languages  and we never felt uncomfortable. The beach is right outside the resort (sandy) but be careful when going into the sea it\u2019s rocky under foot there is a lovely promenade which you can walk all the way into side old town.

We loved absolutely everything about the holiday village and we will be back to stay again. Staff The Melas resort has a real international mix of guests and the staff so an amazing job communicating in a wide range of languages. Some of them have stronger English, some stronger German but all have the basics and they will refer on to someone who can talk your language if there is something they don't understand. The lady at guest relations at the reception was amazing. Incedibly helpful and friendly. All the staff worked hard and were pleasant and friendly. The hotel is kept immaculately clean and our maid always kept our room pristine.  The entertainment team were fab, lots on offer and the evening shows were good. We loved the circus shows and Michael Jackson. The head of entertainment made time for everyone and genuinely cared that each and every guest was having a hood holiday. Food and Drink There was a great range of food available in usual all inclusive buffet style. The food was delicious and there was plenty of choice. My children loved the pancakes at breakfast. There are other restaurants on site and you can book one for each week you stay. We ate at the Turkish and Fish restaurant during our stay and had wonderful meals at both. The  Turkish pisa doughnuts at the aquapark and gozeleme at the beach bar have to be tried during your stay. There was a good range of drink available on the all inclusive including some alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails which were all delicious. Facilities The site has lots on offer. The main pools were great with smaller paddling pools for little children. The aquapark with the slides was great fun for children and adults alike and the lazy river was a nice change of pace. The lifeguards at the aquapark did a great job of making sure everyone was safe. My children went to the kids club a few times and enjoyed it. My eldest was allowed to go to either mini or maxi club as he was nearly 9 and that was perfect for him.  The really enjoyed darts and golf.  On fridays they have inflatables on the green for the children. This was brilliant a wide range of bouncy castles and drinks put at the edge for the inevitably warm kids. There are loads of activities available each day and pool tables, table tennis etc... Location The hotel is just over a miles walk from Side.  The town is amazing, ruins everywhere so fantastic to explore. My two horrible history fanatics loved looking for mosaics and imagining what happened. The only ruins charged for were the ampitheatre and the museum. The charges for these were small and well worth it. The walk to Side was manageable in the cool but we used the Dolmus bus often at least one way. The stop is outside the hotel and its east to use and cheap. Outside the hotel there are also many shops and bars for excursions, clothes shopping and food. They are much cheaper than the hotel shop. The beach is on the hotels doorstep and always had plenty of sunbeds. The water was lovely and the sand great for sandcastles and digging! There are rocks in the water, so I would advise beach shoes. My kids loved the beach and spotted lots of fish.  Overall We loved every moment of our holiday and we'll be back.  The hotel was good enough you could just stay put if you so wished but the surrounding town and countryside were beautiful and not to far for those who like exploring.\u2026", "date": "August 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d314859-r700828385", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Fabulous Family holiday ...... wow ......", "review": "Having never visited Turkey before , we was a bit apprehensive of what to expect ...... let me assure you , it was outstanding ....  When we checked in , at 11.30pm , the young lady , took our names and passports , attached our all inclusive bands , told us to leave our luggage in reception and go to the adjoining bar for refreshments and to the restaurant for food after our journey. Her English is a lot better than my Turkish , we returned to reception , where we was shown a map and explained the dos and fonts and where stuff is around the resort , then we was shown to a golf buggy with our luggage and driven to our room. (Great start to our holiday). The resort is mainly foreign tourists from Germany etc , I would say about 5% English . This was no problem to us , we communicated and got along fine with fellow guests and respect in the pool and around sunbathing areas etc . It is immaculately cared for , teams of gardeners tending to the plants , teams of maids tending to the rooms , you could not fault the grounds or the surroundings. The restaurant serves a wide range of food , stuff we had never tried before , but delicious , (I didn\u2019t travel to Turkey expecting to have a full English every morning ....), you do have to be prepared to adapt your diet a bit , a bbq most nights cooking meats etc, loads of salad and fresh fruit and desserts. The waiting staff are really friendly(Musa and Mehmet to name a couple) and ensure , your glass is always filled . Tip the staff they deserve it !! The animation/entertainment , work hard to ensure that everyone has a good time , live shows most nights and pool party afterwards , where everyone gets together no matter the nationalities ..... There are 2 main pools and an aqua park pool , the sun beds around the main pool are keenly taken early , but we found the quieter aqua park area to get sun beds up until 10am and most afternoons .  The beach has plenty of beds throughout the day , the resort has its own segregated part of the beach , with own lifeguards (also pool areas) and 24hr security for peace of mind. We had a 2 bedroom apartment, it\u2019s a bit dated , but had a free safe , a free mini bar , restocked every second day ( water goes , soft drinks and beer). The bed were comfortable and bathroom stocked with shower gel etc and lovely shower. I recommend a Turkish Bath , it\u2019s amazing and massage afterwards very relaxing .  We had an absolute amazing time , and look forward to returning again .....

Few times there was disco party at the pool after the show.  Beach area is big and there were plenty of seats even during the day.
