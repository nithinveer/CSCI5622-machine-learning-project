Each day the golf carts were loaded up with your clubs and waiting for you when you walked out the back door....they make everything easy. Played the Fazio and the Squire courses first. Very soggy due to extensive rain but both enjoyable layouts. Can't give a perfectly accurate assessment without playing them in decent weather but would consider them both as typical Florida courses:-- very good condition, plenty of water, but nothing too out of the ordinary for Florida. The Championship course is what you come for! The course struck me as very fair (surprisingly wide fairways for a PGA tour course) with guarded greens, but not \"tricked up\" at all. Greens were predictable and rolled beautifully.

We had a bad experience with Enterprise Car Rental but Antonella provided the customer service that Enterprise was lacking.  Antonella also recommended great restaurant choices for us.  Barolo was fantastic as was Anthonys Pizza.  Back to PGA National.  We played the Champions course twice and it was a great experience.  I have great memories of the course and will enjoy watching the Honda Classic on TV even more.  The room was very nice.  Facilities were great especially the pool area.

The food IS great, however expensive, and the rooms are clean and all and all, it is a great place to stay and play golf.

I had an excellent and relaxing stay.  We had a very prompt check in and were given a nice double room on the ground floor with easy access and a view of the pool.  The rooms are nice and are stocked well. The best part of the trip was the Spa.  The spa is so relaxing and the treatments were wonderful.  The sugar scrub was one of the most relaxing treatments I have ever had. Also loved being able to wind down and relax after my massage. The food is good but expensive due to the 18% gratuity that is added to everything along with the tax.  Favorite meal was the thai salmon salad at the spa.

My complaint isn't with the quality of the courses. It is with what you get for the money. We were charged a premium to play the Champion Course, but as they were readying it for the Honda Classic, the greens had been sanded, and the resulting putting conditions were terrible. We had a group of 20 golfers for 5 days and 7 rounds of golf. Arrangements had been made months in advance, yet PGA was \"unable\" to give us rooms anywhere near each other. We were spread out over 4 floors. This was problematic the last day as they made us vacate our rooms before our morning round (no late checkout) and move all of our luggage to 3 rooms separated by 2 floors. \u2026", "date": "January 2013", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34531-d113369-r151245109", "sub_review": {"Value": 2, "Location": 4, "Sleep Quality": 4, "Rooms": 3, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 3}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 3}, {"title": "A luxurious room, great food and a fabulous golf experience", "review": "I stayed two nights at the PGA National Resort in the \"Media Suite\", which had more TVs than I have eyeballs, a Bose sound system, a luxurious bedroom and bath, and a charming little balcony overlooking the pool, shaded by a massive palm tree that provided great privacy.

I expected luxury accomodations and excellent service and got neither. The rooms are in need of repair & updating. I had a foot of water in the shower with me.

We did get i imagine a very good walk in rate, especially as it was low season. I have done a fair bit of travelling over the years and this hotel is a real treat. Luxurious, clean and the rooms are impressive. With two children we were not typical guests and felt more comfortable eating outside the hotel. The pool and surrounding gardens were fantastic and we really enjoyed our stay before we could pick up our itinery in the keys.
