Bathroom was small but ok for us, shower a bit tight and difficult to manage as the wall bracket was loose, the handset leaked and would not stay in place also no shelf or anything to place shower gel or shampoo but the water was nice and hot.  Small basket of complimentary soap and shower gel available. Towels changed daily. Large mirror in bathroom, none in bedroom but this is a small family hotel. No kettle but that's normal for Italy, tea and coffee available at breakfast, can be bought at other times from the bar.

Sure the towels are a tad thin but it is not the Ritz but it is value for money. The \" very basic \" review  2 miles from the lake is just wrong the hotel door to the lake side is 1.05 miles I ran down and back every morning during my stay  and if  fit and in kit you should be able to get back from the lake in 13 minutes.

If you would like the quieter version of Torbole this would probably be ok for you. It was basic accomodation and the breakfast consisted of standard fare.

The pictures often include a picture of a private beach. This does exist but is deceiving because it is over 2 km away. Also the swimming pool is only about 1m deep and is quite small so if you are booking for beach and pool facilities then be warned!
