We are a couple who visit new places to see the places, not hang out in the hotel...so Meddusa was perfect...the perfect place from which to explore Old Istanbul. The staff were very kind and went the extra mile. We felt like we were among family...nice family not dysfunctional family. We opted for having breakfast here. It was healthy with extremely fresh produce. We enjoyed the roof top terrace every morning...and one evening took a bottle of wine there. We had it to ourselves as the sun went down. The staff helped us with a corkscrew and glasses. We enjoyed feeling we were part of the community...shop keepers geeting us as we walked through the area. We slept with the window open. Some might not like the street noise but we felt it contributed to our experience of the community.

There is nothing to complain about this hotel. Hotels in istanbul is overpriced and if you are looking for a nice and cozy sleep in a budget with own ensuite, then this is the one . This small hotel is just 5 minutes walk from Sultanahmet tram stop, although you need to do a bit of searching before you can locate it. The stairs leading to the hotel is a bit doggy, a small reception area and an even smaller room . Our twin room on the third floor is very small but clean , just have enough room to manuvoure and the bathroom is even worst, hardly any room even for Asians.

The reviews that I read about Meddusa before booking the hotel were, overall, very good. But I was terribly disappointed with the hotel. I believe I can evaluate this hotel fairly as it was the second (two star) hotel  that I stayed in the same (Blue Mosque) region within one month.   In Meddusa I stayed for four nights with my girlfriend. The first shock was the extremely small room; I went down the reception and asked if they could change the room.
