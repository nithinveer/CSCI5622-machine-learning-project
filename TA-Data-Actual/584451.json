On getting to the hotel I was suprised as it looked nothing like it did in the brochure, when booking in at reception the staff were so nice and helpful. The room I was in was perfect! Recently refurbished it was clean and alot more than I expected. The room was cleaned every day and beds remade. My stay in the hotel was a all round pleasant experience all the staff was polite and helpful and made me feel very welcome. The pool area and pool was also clean and tidy. I would not say it's a hotel for young adults as there isn't a lot to do but for couples and the younger children it's the perfect place. I would definitely return to this hotel...", "date": "May 2015", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580283-d584451-r271900612", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 5}]
