The underground parking garage is located across the street from the hotel and they provide a 40% discount. Very clean and bright room.  We were able to rent beach chairs from the front desk for a nominal fee.  Breakfast was good, whether you wanted a full buffet or just off the menu.  A 2 minute walk to the beautiful, wide beach with soft sand.  A very pleasant hotel with many restaurants near by.  The bus stop was close, which will take you into the old town of Cadiz in 15 minutes.  The bus was great to use.

The Hotel is right next to the beach, so the location couldn't be better, there are numerous bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity, most of which we visited, and the \"Hop-on-hop-off\" bus stop is just opposite the entrance to the Hotel. We mentioned on our booking that it was a \"Special occasion\" and were afforded an Apartment on the 6th floor, with full views of the City and beach, so this added to our overall experience. The staff were all very helpful, but special mention must go to the young lad in the breakfast room/cafe, who went above and beyond, to ensure our stay was perfect. The breakfast was very nice, which considering there were a host of different nationalities, shows how much they try to please everyone. Parking was very easy too, with a car park approx 15-20 metres away, which is also discounted, if you are staying at the Hotel.

We flew easyJet from Bristol. Just 1hr 20mins drive. The Hotel Playa Victoria is located right on the beach and we had no complaints. Check-in was smooth and welcoming and the car park under the hotel had plenty of spaces. Yes, it's tight but just take it slow. The room - 414 - was a corner room at the end of the corridor on the 4th floor and boy, what a view. A twin room, bit rough around the edges. By that I mean the furniture was a bit scuffed that's all. Its a beach hotel. Lovely balcony and views front and to the right towards the Old Town. Fab beach. Stretches for miles. The room was clean, spacious, loads of storage, comfy beds and a big bathroom. Shower in the bath but you can't have everything. Loads of hot water, loo & bidet. Lift close by takes you down to the pool & beach. Sun loungers & umbrellas available out front (public beach) for 6 euros per day. Breakfast busy and plentiful. Don't forget to order fresh coffee (and tea) for the table rather than get it from a machine. Loads of bread, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereals, cheese & meat, pastries etc. Best to get there before 9am if you can. Lots of restaurants in the area within 5 minutes walk. Arrebol was nice. Take a cab or an Uber to the Old City for about 7 euros (one way). Great restaurants, cobbled streets, shopping & culture (cathedral and tower are great) to be had there. We ate at Taberna El Tio de la Tiza (opens at 9pm) just like Rick Stein. Fab fishfood. Also Los Napolitanos for a very reasonable Italian in a side street. Nice staff. We would have tried Confusione for pizza but didn't get there. Took the car to Sanlucar de Barrameda one day. Lovely place to visit. Great squares, restaurants and beach.All in all, Cadiz surprised us (positively) and The Hotel Playa Victoria was a great place to stay. No real negatives.
