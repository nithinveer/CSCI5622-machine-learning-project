(b) Air conditioning worked very well, and the room was cool despite the vicious heat outside  (c) Breakfast was great.  Rolls, several types of croissant, cheese, meat, cereal, juice, bread (for toast) and excellent coffee.  Nothing was stale.  (d) It was comfortable and quiet at night (my room faced the rear)  (e) The tram from the airport is a 7 minute walk away (Buonsignori Liceo da Vinci); it also goes to the city centre.  Or walk to the city centre in 30 minutes.  The Hotel is VERY well placed for the San Donato university campus (10 minute walk) and there are plenty of places to eat nearby, as well as a good supermarket.

Later on, I realized that the only possibility is the air ventilation! Like other guests who have stayed here, they also experienced the same problem. I suspect there's a small pool of dirty water/reservoir near the central ventilation compartment for the mosquitoes to breed then travel into the ventilation pipes into different rooms.
