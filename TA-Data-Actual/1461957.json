The rooms are a bit on the small side, but to be expected in Florence (we were in a luxury twin room and it still felt a bit small).    The negatives (which will keep me from returning to the hotel) are (1) it is loud.  This is due to its location, but boy is it loud - people are out in the streets all hours of the night, and there are a few bars right near the hotel that seems to exacerbate the problem.  I live in the city and am not particularly sensitive to city noise, but this was at another level - it was truly the loudest hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in.

Unfortunately, our experience was not pleasant.    During our first night, the lights in our room kept flickering and the safe kept resetting and beeping. It took the staff many hours to determine it was an issue with the hotel and not user error.  I don't blame the staff for the problems, but I would've appreciated being informed of the issues and/or perhaps offered something small (e.g, a bottle of wine) due to all the lack of sleep.  It wasn't until we called Expedia that anything was done for us.  During our second night, the noise from the pub across the street kept us awake.  We were not pleased.  Considering this is a high-end hotel, we had higher expectations. I won't stay there again.", "date": "November 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d1461957-r545374249", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Solid choice for central Florence", "review": "Location is superb, staff are friendly and attentive. Breakfast room is small but perfectly functional, with a good choice of foods and lovely service from waiting staff.   Rooms are well appointed but I would say more equivalent to a UK 4 star rather than 5. The hotel may well have awarded itself the extra star due to the spa provision, which we did not use.  The only one negative is that we stayed at the end of February and it was quite mild but the heating was on and cooking us! Upon raising this with the hotel staff, it seems that Italian Govt have strict rules about heating in winter. We were able to have our heating turned off, but were not permitted to have the air conditioning on.

At noon I was falling asleep in my cappucino so we came back to the hotel and the receptionist showed me the status of our room on their computer system. It showed a logo of a maid in the room and the receptionist promised we would be able to go upstairs and rest as soon as it was ready.

Although the check-in time is well communicated in all web sites, besides Expedia where you booked, when possible it is a pleasure for us to assign the room before 3 pm.  All our staff is trained to provide the best welcome to all guests, as you can easily infer from most of our reviews and also in your case we have been working to make your stay as enjoyable as possible but unfortunately the first approach was not the best.  We are in very high season and fortunately the hotel is often fully booked, for this reason sometimes we cannot offer alternatives.  You arrived to the Hotel at 9:30 am asking if the room was ready. You were informed that the room was still busy with the guest in house and would not be ready before 3 pm. Anyhow the staff took your mobile phone number in order to inform you promptly in case the room would be ready in advance.  Our Staff did the check-in, they offered you the Breakfast and took care of your bags.  After a walking, you came back to the Hotel a few minutes after 12 pm. At that time the previous guest had just left the room and the maid started the first step of cleaning at 12.19 pm (all the accesses were recorded) and ended At 13:04. At 13.05, the second bellhop, (moquette cleaner and marble cleaner), entered the room and worked till 13:48. You entered in the room at 13.50 instead of 15.00, even if the carpet was not completely dried properly yet.  From 12:00 to 13:45 you came to the reception desk at least 3 times asking if the room was ready and to speed up the cleaning operations.  Considering your priority to have the room immediately our Staff proposed you the only room available at the moment, but unfortunately with 2 separate beds.  Nevertheless The staff assured you that the room would be ready in 5 minutes  Mrs. Sara, our front office manager, has been working with the Golden Tower Hotel & Spa since the opening (2009). Until today she has always been recognized by the guests, as well as being praised for their knowledge and professionalism.  Where did we go wrong? .... maybe in wanting to assign you a room with impeccable cleanliness?  Usually the cleaning time of a room is about 1 hour and half,  but upon every departure the situation could be different and these operations required more time.  Since your are still our welcome guest, we remain at your full disposal for any clarification information and / or necessity.  At the same time, we think that ratings/reviews, especially if negative, must first be constructive and should also be written at the end of the stay, evaluating their stay permanently.

The hotel itself is lovely, good sized rooms and a beautiful large bathroom.  Reception staff were great and on-hand every time we had a question with helpful advice and tips.  Good solid wifi as well!  Breakfast was included and the only downside is that the breakfast room is quite small so you need to be there early if you are a large party or you'll have to sit separately.  Food was usual continental selection but also had limited hot breakfast.  Lots of cakes though :-)   Lots of bars restaurants and shopping on your step.
