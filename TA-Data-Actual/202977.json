The front desks were manned by two staffs, who eyed us suspiciously and kept asking questions when one of us was going to the toilet. We were informed that cars couldn't park in front of the hotel because it is resided in a residential area, but failed to informed us, as guests, where to park otherwise. If it was not due to exhaustion after a long drive, we might have decided to cancel our stay.  Another bad experience was at the breakfast.

I'm really sorry for what happened with your reservation, but as our collegues on duty during the night told you, we never received your booking on our system (now is all automatic and normal it works very well). At your arrival, after midnight, they were not expecting other Clients and my collegues, as mormal, closed the doors. and they were suspicious to you just because you were unexpected for them and who works at night should also think about the safety of our customers.  Normal at our Client's arrival we always ask if they reached our hotel by car explaning that we have a parking available and when it is full we will direct them to a private garage which is two minutes walking away from our hotel. You can find all this informations also on our website. I saw on your review that you liked your rooms and I apologize for all the troubles you had with your booking ( I repeat now all is automatic and normal it works very well but sometimes could happen ) and I hope yu enjoyed your stay in our town.

The basic mistake - gave us double rooms when we wanted twin ones. All fine, I thought - just need to go downstairs and ask them to change it. And so I did.
