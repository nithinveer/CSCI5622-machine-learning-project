[{"title": "First Staycation But Not The Last!", "review": "Good first impression during a very short stay! The hotel is located near Universal Studios where on Kirkman Road and Major Blvd, there are many restaurants to choose from. The well-lit and airy lobby opens into the breakfast area. At front desk Mitesh welcomed me as Choice Rewards member and politely asked my preference for a beverage and snack or extra points, which I appreciated. My special room requests were also honored which made me feel like a special guest. Parking is free. My room was a very large one-bedroom suite with a let out sofa, microwave, mini frig, iron, ironing board and single coffee maker, etc. The appliances looked new and were very quiet. I liked the efficient use of space and plenty of electrical outlets for multiple devices. Along the longest wall were three areas that could be used for desk space including an extra roll out table. In addition to the usual mini soaps, bottles of shampoo, lotion, etc. in the bathroom, there were other little extras like a shower cap and surface wipes throughout the room. The bath tub was somewhat narrow but not an issue if just shower and do not bathe. I usually post pics of my hotel room before I unpack but having a hotel room that looks just like the hotel website pictures lends credibility to the hotel and my room did just that. My room, bed linens and floor were very clean and there were plenty of towels and pillows. The bed was very comfortable making for a good night's sleep. Check out with a very friendly Sandy was effortless. She was great! This was our very first staycation here but will not be our last.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d250130-r724832055", "sub_review": {"Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Business Overnight / Meeting Room", "review": "Staff was friendly and helpful.

This summer we had planned to stay again and called the Hotel directly to see if we could get their best price for 3 rooms for 2 weeks, given the price had gone up in recent years and the dollar-sterling rate had made 3 rooms quite expensive. I spoke with a female at the Hotel - I believe the general manager, and I was quoted an incredibly cheap rate for the 3 rooms for 2 weeks. 3 or 4 times during the call, I questioned the rate, since it seemed to cheap and asked whether this was really the 3 room\u2026", "date": "May 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d250130-r680262057", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "We loved it!", "review": "Dear AJG502014  I am terribly sorry to read about your experience regarding your booking and cancellation.

If you don't go early or even the night before you may not get a seat.  This is hands down one of the best hotels in the area.

We are more than happy to make considerations for our guests, when it comes to hooking up a game system. We would normally just send someone from maintenance to ensure the hook up is done properly to avoid an damage to our TV's. I have recently walked a number of rooms and verified the water temp and pressure and all seems fine. I will be sure to monitor this closer going forward to ensure the proper temperature and pressure if available to my guests. I can assure you, this has nothing to do with cost saving, as we want our guests to be as comfortable as possible.

However, we stayed at this hotel with our 8 year old son and he left behind a special toy. When we called, the front desk \"manager\" was not helpful in any way and was sarcastic. I was told that she was not able to check the room. I asked if she would simply call the room (it was already booked) and explain the situation, and after some coaxing she finally did. She then told me that she would call me the next day after having someone check. That was three days ago and I have not heard from her since.

The pool was ok, the hot tub was  luke warm at best and the pool area closed at 10PM. If I were to go to Universal again I would probably look for another hotel as there were many in this same area with compariable rates.

It was VERY close to Universal Studios, and in a safe area.  The room was spacious and clean, but the bedding had quite a few stains on the bedspread.  The breakfast was good (they even had waffles that you could make).  I didn't hear any noise through the walls, but I slept with the AC on.    The staff weren't especially helpful, though, and even gave incorrect information about local things.   If you want to stay somewhere close to Universal, this is an OK place.  But, there were lots of other hotels rights next to it, just as close, if you'd want a different option.

We approached our stay at this hotel with some trepidation after reading a couple scathing reviews on TripAdvisor; however, we were very pleasantly surprised by our experience there. The people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The hotel looks very nice outside and inside. We had absolutely no problem with our room. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. We appreciated having the microwave and small refrigerator. I also liked the location of the hotel off the main drag. We found it to be very quiet, even though there appeared to be lots of kids staying there. The breakfast provided each morning was good. I enjoyed the waffles.

At checkin, I approached the two young ladies at the desk, who seemed quite \"put out\" that I should interrupt there \"chit-chat.\"  There were a number of problems during my stay, one of which I'll briefly describe.  The morning after checkin, I left the room to get a cup of coffee.  Upon returning, my key would not allow me to enter.  With electronic locks, that is not too much of a surprise....however, when I went to the front desk, I once again met the clerk \"with an attitude\" who informed me that my credit card had been declined.
