It is not fancy, but pleasant and well cared for. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Laundry on site.   We got bumped to a beach view room - lovely - and they all had comfortable decks to enjoy. Pool room views also have patios and I think they would be horrible in season. They are too close to the pool and afford little privacy.

I would prefer bigger coffee pots in the rooms instead of having to goto the lobby, but it was nice that it was offered there.  We vistied the Pink Shell, it was very nice but crowded with lots of kids and people.  Not what I am looking for when I want to have a family vacation with my own children.

In 76 we moved to Tampa. To this day, I still frequent the Sandpiper. Sometimes I go with my Mom and last year went with my own family. What great memories have from my childhood and now with my own with my family. I totally recommend this place. It is quiet, relaxing and a perfect location. I prefer the first floor ocean view or pool view. Not the high rise. Probably because this is where we always stayed when I was little. I actually keep a picture of it in at my desk at work to remind me of the relaxation I get there!

I questioned the front desk staff and GM to see if they remembered a guest that had reported having issues as you mentioned on your Trip Advisor review and they were not familiar with your myriad of issues   reported.   I certainly would have preferred if you had reported your issue to Mr. Montoya the GM and we might have been able to resolve your dilemma before we tainted a 4 year relationship with a repeat guest.   I have overseen the Sandpiper as part of my Florida Resort division since Feb of 2005 and although I don't spend a great deal of time at the front desk I would have been more than happy to discuss your issues as would have my GM.   My concern is that many issues you mentioned are services we provide routinely for our guests without being prompted for example early check in (if the room is ready), taking your cell phone number to contact you when the room is ready, use of the facilities while you wait and even the storage of refrigerated items in one of our two common refrigerators.   I see to it that formal ongoing training is done with our various resort staff and by reviewing the other more favorable reviews we receive it seems to be working.   You mentioned about staff vehicles being in the way or cleaning of pool desks at 8am being an annoyance. Unfortunately we have to have the two pools open by 9am each morning and as you were well aware we had upwards of 300 people using our facility during this peak time of year so keeping it clean is a necessary task. We wait until 8am even though the city ordinance allows for this type of work as early as 7am so that our guests are not disturbed. Also the units have hurricane rated doors and windows so the noise should have been minimal had you slept with the sliders closed. Our check in time is as soon as the unit is ready or by 4pm. Sometimes there are issues with a unit, or a volume of cleaning that prevents us from getting everyone in by that time. In those cases we would have offered to compensate you in a reasonable fashion for the delay.   My e-mail is Plandis@tcgr.com if you would like to discuss your issues further or you feel I need to address specific employees that will make the vacation experience better for all.

I appreciate you taking the time to rate the resort and give us shining marks. I wanted to address your comments in areas that need attention.   We are in the procees right now of taking bids for several items. The Sandpiper suites were completely remodeled in 2004. The properties exterior was repainted last year and the courtyard areas were re landscaped this year. We plan to remodel the bathrooms this fall or in offseason next year as we may lose the down time period once we go through the permitting red tape. The bath remodeling bids will include a tile floor option to get away from the pergo flooring. While there are just a few units that the floor has gotten damp tile will add to te bath ambience. The tubs will be replaced with either showers or new tubs and new wall tile.  Our rental management is meeting with the directors on changes to the bedspreads as the drapes are custom so color matching is crucial.   You are correct about housekeeping reporting any items that need addressed in the units. They sometimes have limited time on busier periods that reduces their ability to report an item as prompt as we would like but by all means if you find something unsatisfactory please contact the front desk and we will address it propmptly.

We enjoyed visiting the pier, restaurants, bars, etc., but preferred to stay in a more quiet area.  If you want to be able to walk to everything, this isn't the place for you. 2.  While the Sandpiper is a great deal for the price, it is more of a hotel/motel than a \"resort.\"  If you want a place where people deliver little umbrella drinks to you while you sit in your chair, this is not the place for you.
