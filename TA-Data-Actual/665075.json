Secondly the food was very 'continental' but we liked the variety and quality that was served to us. The dining room staff are attentive and pleasant. Reception staff were engaging and extremely helpful. The only negative side for us what the hotel took dogs!  But that apparently it's common in Italy.

I looked up the web for the Hotel Royal and worried for 2 days about the holiday. When we saw our room, we thought this isn't as bad as it could be. Quite basic, but you don't spend your holiday in the room. It was one of the smaller doubles overlooking the pool. The food was better than some of the reviews suggested. Evening meals - soup (but I never had that), a good variety of salad, usually 3 choices of meat or fish, a pasta dish, potatoes (really good roasted with rosemary one night) and a vegetable. A different pudding each night all good. Breakfast didn't have a lot of variety, but it was a continental breakfast with meats and cheese. Never had the egg. For the money it was very reasonable.

We returned from our holiday 28th July 2007, after a 2 week stay in riva del garda, Italy. We had a good holiday over all(2 adults & 2 children, 5 & 2yrs). The hotel was clean,4 star rating, but it was really a 3 star. The staff were nice, the food was ok for adults, but children found it hard, breakfast was only meat, hard rolls, solid boiled eggs and well done scrambled egg,with cereal, sometmes left over dessert from night before! Lake Garda its self was a lovely place, just not a lot for children,but that was our fault for booking and not checking. We went on a trip to the capital Verona and the dolomites, that was good.

There was also a TV and air con. We also asked to be moved and despite the alternative room been  bigger but it was on the 1st floor and over looked the hotel car park and had no balcony so we stayed put. We only did B&B as we enjoy going out to different places to eat and drink , but we did eat one night at the hotel which was nice enough and saved us having to walk into the old town of Riva.

It seems that if there was a corner to cut to save money, then this hotel did it! The 1st room we were offered was on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool. However, to squeeze between a dressing table and the wall to get to the bed was not an ideal start. We asked to change rooms and were given a bigger room overlooking the trailer park, but it was a lot better. Breakfast was not much better, with powdered juice and powdered eggs made to look scrambled, accompanied by slices of meat - not the best start to the day! Dinner was not great either, again powdered soup. The staff were, however, lovely, helpful and friendly. The pool was not very inviting as it was surrounded by red and white hazzard chain.\u2026", "date": "July 2007", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194883-d665075-r8134063", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 2}]
