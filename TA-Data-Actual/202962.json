I had a junior suite on the 4th floor with a wooden floor, approximately 27 square metres but it felt a bit small and wasn't as spacious as it looked in the management photos. There wasn't enough space between the bed and the desk and it was a tight squeeze when sitting on the chair at the desk.  There was a huge couch with lots of cushions and on that side of the bed there was plenty of space but the TV on the wall opposite the bed didn't rotate to face the couch and the remote control was difficult to activate from the couch. The bed had two single mattresses with a mattress topper but I still noticed them and would have preferred one large mattress. However, the bed was very comfortable and so were the pillows. The wardrobe had two parts, one with hangers and the other with shelves, a safe and the minibar which had a nice selection of drinks and you get two free bottles of water every day. The Wifi worked very well throughout the hotel.  There were no individual toiletries in the bathroom which had no shelf space except for a small ledge under the mirror, just a dispenser of liquid soap and shampoo. The shampoo wasn't the best and I had to wash my long hair twice in two days. When using the bidet I had to go over to the soap dispenser first to get some liquid soap. There was a shower cap and a vanity set with cotton pads, Q tips and an emery board. There was no body lotion.  Some people complained about the noise but I didn't notice much noise.  There is a small gym in the basement with a bike, treadmill, stepper, multistation, benches and barbells which is fine for a workout.  The breakfast was alright but I hated the sugary juices and you had to pay extra if you wanted a freshly squeezed juice.  I had dinner and lunch at the hotel restaurant in the lobby and it was just alright, nothing special and the Caesar's salad with chicken for \u20ac10 was smothered in mayonnaise and not a real Caesar's salad dressing. It also just had a few slices of cheese on top instead of grated parmesan. There are some restaurants nearby either on the other side of the street towards the centre or turn right out of the hotel and walk to Via Il Prato where there are quite a few along with a laundrette and a Carrefour Express.  When you go out of the hotel turn right to go to the tram station for Tram 1 and get on on the same side as the hotel and the Torre della Serpe to go into the town centre. It's one stop to the end of the line Alamanni - Santa Maria Novella then you can either walk into the centre or get Tram 2 one more stop to the end of its line Unit\u00e0. Tram 2 also goes the other way to the airport. Tickets cost \u20ac1.50 and you can buy them from the hotel reception.  The hotel is a 10 minute drive from the airport. Come out of the airport and turn right, go to the end of the building then turn right again to find the taxi stand were the prices are prominently displayed. It costs \u20ac22 during the day to go into town, \u20ac24 on a Bank Holiday and \u20ac25.30 at night (10pm - 6am) plus a supplement of \u20ac2.70 when catching a taxi from the airport and \u20ac1 per suitcase. However, beware of the drivers when paying by credit card. I took taxi Atene 18 and when we arrived at the hotel, the driver took my contactless credit card and before I knew it, he'd added \u20ac3 for paying by credit card. I insisted he gave me my \u20ac3 back in cash so before you hand over your credit card, make sure you see what the charge is and some of the taxi drivers obviously just can't help themselves (and I speak fluent Italian!).  The staff on reception were very friendly and I really have to compliment the amazing housekeeping staff who made up my room to look like new throughout my 4 night stay. It was a real pleasure to come back to a perfectly made-up room and this is one of the reasons I'm giving this hotel 5 stars.\u2026", "date": "September 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d202962-r720894586", "sub_review": {"Location": 4, "Rooms": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Very Nice Hotel.", "review": "Dear Guest,  We are glad to hear that you appreciated your stay in terms of product, quality of service, and cleanliness.

It is still a lovely 3 bridge walk to get closer to the famous attractions but I liked being away from the crowds at night. The rooms are modern and well equipped. The bathroom was very clean, modern, but little space for toiletry bags for two people. We had a nice view of a park, light rail system and Sunsets. The windows open for fresh air!

Breakfast was included, but cold bacon and cold scrambled eggs don't cut it for me.... why not have someone make them fresh for those who want it? Rest of breakfast is fine, fresh fruit (important!), good rolls and croissants, good cereal selection and very good coffee.  Nice bar though I would suggest they either change the video on the big TV screen, it becomes really boring really quickly, or turn the thing off entirely. It serves no purpose once you've seen the ad for the Starhotels about 50 times in an hour. And because the screen is over the fireplace, you are drawn to look at it....

It was equipped with TV (in the bedroom AND bathroom), mini bar, coffee machine, PPV with internet access plus slippers and robes.  Twin beds were joined to make a larger bed but was very comfortable.  For the tourist attractions, it was about a 30 - 35 minute walk.  All you needed to do was just turn left when you leave the hotel and follow the river down - very easy.  Buffet breakfast was included in the package.  The usual breads, croissants, cereal, fruits, cold cuts, bacon, eggs, etc.  A decent selection.  The service was friendly and helpful as well. \u2026", "date": "May 2007", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d202962-r8140870", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Location": 2, "Check in / front desk": 4, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 4, "Business service (e.g., internet access)": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Nice business hotel", "review": "After spending fours days in Rome, I spent three days in Florence and stayed at this hotel where I had a wonderful experience.

We were impressed with the facilty to select the type of pillow you most prefer!   Breakfast was good but you have to ask for cappucino or latte. It seemed that if you weren't Italian you didn't get this unless you asked the staff directly!
