[{"title": "Internet ", "review": "I am currently staying at the Adalya Resort & Spa, I researched this hotel on trip advisor, YouTube and their website ensuring the hotel facilities . (Internet)To my horror when we arrived to be told wifi only in the reception area (free) but we have to pay to have wifi in our room price of 3 euros per person on each devices daily. I challenged the management asking why this is not place on the hotel profile? why wait for your customers to arrived to be told three euro for each devices daily . I will strongly advice anybody looking to booked this hotel please call the hotel first get clarity on theirs facilities (advertising incorrect information) also speak to your booking agents to double checked what you are paying for !!   I am happy with the staff they are wonderful, beautiful room can\u2019t complaint food ok so far (day 5 )  Indoor pool close, bad accident last year  causing indoor pool to be closed.  \u2026", "date": "September 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6536761-d1487044-r613056328", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 1}, {"title": "It is good in its category", "review": "The location of the hotel is good, just a park walkway from the sandy beach. The hotel is very clean and well maintained, the staff are very nice, they work a lot. The choice of food and drink is adequate and satisfying. The beach is a bit crowded, but the pool area is not. Half of the guests are about German, and here's a small problem. Everything about them, services, informations, entertainment, etc. It was like a German hotel.

We had a nice 11 days vacation. The first impression was bit confusing, but after few days we get used and we can consider the vacation as quite good. The hotel has some negatives and some positives.  positives  - spacy rooms  - animation team is friendly and always positive  - clean beach  - turkish night food  negatives  - german only speaking stuff (except reception and animation team). Does not understand basic english spoken requests.  - beach bags - only for german guests? looks like that. We saw couple of guests with hotel beach bags, but we did not found any in our room  - mini club - extra payment for t-shirt painting and some other activities. Looks like tiny budget for animations.  - ultra all inclusive is not so ultra. foreign alcohol for fee  - small beach is full.

The hotel is quite small for the resort standards which was a bonus as the atmosphere at the hotel was more relaxed and you could actually enjoy just lying by one of the pools or have a nice quiet lunch without having to listen to people screaming around you.  The rooms are a good size and really nice and freshly decorated with wooden floors and every room had a balcony with a view of the sea. We didn't think it was possible and even though we got a room at the furthest corner of the hotel we were able to see the sea.

This should not put off any other nationality!    The Hotel was clean and tidy throughout our 12 day stay.  Our room was a decent size and always cleaned.  There was a small balcony which was more than adequate for the family to sit have sundowners on.  The activities for children were excellent, and our child learnt German as well!! There is a private beach area outside the hotel about 20m.   The stand out was the food which was outstanding throughout our stay.   Always extremely fresh and well presented.    Transport to Side was via local minibus and cost about a euro.  The minibus stop is only 50m behind the hotel.
