Hotel was nice and clean, is easily accessible, good accomidtions, has shopping center across the road and a couple gas stations within walking distance.  Check-In: Went well & no complaints. The shuttle driver(s) and front desk clerks had recommended Sliders for supper, was adult bar/restaurant. It's right across the road and has good food. Is also a Dollar Store and Big Lots for small last minute items.  Shuttle to Port Everglades: at Check-Out, we paid $15 per person for shuttle to the port. It was like 'the short bus'. Driver was polite and professional. There were several groups of us going on difft ships at same time and I think 3 shuttles. The GM came out and spoke to each load of us. He thanked us for staying with him, enjoy your visit and cruise, and pleasure doing business with us. The girl at the front counter was Kim, they're both the same people we saw pictures of on website (which was nice). The driver got us & luggage to the RC terminal safe & sound.  Shuttle to airport: ALL STAR TOURS upon deboarding from the RC ship, the shuttle was spot-on waiting for us. He got our voucher, took our luggage to the trailer and hit the road. He had us back to FLL in no time. Was very nice and got us and our luggage where needed to go....course we gave him a generous tip too. Don't know his name, but he did an excellent job.

Thanks for giving us your feedback about your most recent stay with us.  My sincere apologies that you had a poor experience with our shuttle provider!  I will speak with them when I get back into the office on Monday.  Our cruise port shuttle DID indeed increase over 2 years ago as most shuttle services in the area charge the same amount which is $10 per person.  I will have to search to find out what service still has the old information and get it corrected!  I am sorry about the elevators- we did approve the work a week and half  ago but it has taken the vendor over a week to get the parts. it is quite a pricey fix at $20,000 to get it upgraded, but we did approve it and  are unfortunately at the mercy of the vendor.

If that is not the case, please feel free to contact me directly and we will get it taken care of for you.  Always ask for a manager and we will solve the issue at the desk to prevent poor reviews.

I do understand how this caused you and your wife some anxiety and I again apologize.

Matter of fact, some of our reviews speak about how helpful my staff is and handicap accessible my hotel is.   I am happy that Kim was able to go home and get her personal generator to try and help remedy the hot room for you.   I am also happy that Kim removed your charges for the night.  Again, we always try and do the right thing.  Unfortunately, the building was built 20 years ago and as much as I personally would love a backup Generator, our hotel was not built with one.

Thanks for giving us your feedback on your most recent stay with us.  My apologies that you did not seem to have a good stay with us.

Again, My apologies that it didn't seem to work for you.  It is true, our hotel AC system is set on a motion sensor that does not run 24 hours a day wasting energy. We are a Green property and as such, we are trying to help save energy wherever we can.   The system is set up to come on 5-10 minutes after you move around in the room and does cool the room.

I supposed they are very subjective- some folks like a soft bed, some like a hard bed.  You actually were not charged for \"extra's\".....Most hotels have to ensure that you have money on your card for any Incidental charges you may incur (soda, water, phone calls ect).

My sincere apologies about your experience.  You mentioned not having a microwave and Mini Fridge in the room?  Again my apologies, Since we are just a Hampton Inn and not a Hampton Inn and Suites, all of my rooms do not have the mini fridges, only the king rooms do and the Double Queens do not.  I will have to do some research to find out the way your room was booked.  Some of the Dot coms do not guarantee room types so this could be the issue.  In the future please don't hesitate to ask for a manager if you receive anything other than superior service and we will gladly fix the issue.  Both Myself and my Assistant GM knew nothing about your situation.  Remember we are here to always help!  I noticed that there was no actual feedback about the poor service, just the lack of a mini fridge.

Thanks for taking the time to give us your feedback on your most recent stay with us.  We do appreciate your business!  I am very happy to hear that your room was clean and comfortable.   My sincere apologies that we ran out of a few items on the breakfast buffet.  Sometimes it is very difficult to plan exactly how much breakfast items we will need every weekend (some weekends we may only have 2 per room\u2026.others we have 4 per room).  We do our very best to try and plan ahead, but every now and then we get caught a tad short.  Again my apologies.  What we should have been able to do was merely run out to the grocery store next door and purchase whatever items you were requesting.  I am disappointed that we did not make this happen for you.  As far as the shuttle information goes\u2026..it is pretty simple and never changes\u2026..you sign up AT CHECK IN for whatever time you would prefer from our 3 shuttle offerings of 10:30 am, 11:45 am or 12:30 pm to go over to the Port Everglades Cruise Port.  It is certainly your right to take a cab rather than taking our shuttles if you feel it works better for you and your schedule.

I do however have to question whether you stayed at my hotel,  the Hampton Inn at 2301 SW 12th ave on SR 84? There are 3 Hampton Inn hotels within a 3 mile radius and lots of guests get us confused.   Our Executive Housekeepers actually leave the hotel at 5pm and ALL rooms have to be in the system as clean and ready to be given to guests.  You had mentioned that you were not given a room until after 6pm.  Also our official check in time is 3pm... not 4pm as you stated,  so there would be no reason for you not to have been able to check in by 4pm or 4:30pm at the very latest!   Even on our busiest days.....we have ALL of the rooms in the system by 5pm.  Believe me, I am a stickler for meeting our check in time obligation for our wonderful guests!  I did take the liberty of checking our system for your reservation and there is no Roger F from Loveland that has stayed with my hotel in the last 45 days.  Please allow me to offer you to CONTACT ME DIRECTLY so that i can ensure that this review gets to the correct hotel or so that I may discuss this total lapse in service on the very slim chance that this was our hotel..... and I will make it right with you.

Thanks for giving us your feedback on your most recent stay with us.  We do appreciate your business!   I am sorry that you felt like we are taking advantage of some of the customers during cruise season.  Unfortunately it is all supply and demand!  From December to April our area has a HUGE demand for hotel rooms and even the low end hotels are getting the $150+ rates!  We merely try and \"stay with the Joneses\" and get our fair share of the market.  Is the rate high at times?  Yes....it is...I would be the first to say that....but it is kind of like going to New Orleans during Mardi Gras.....you pay $500 for a $120 room!  Come stay with me in June....I will give you all the $150 and less rooms you will book!....:)    All Joking aside....we do appreciate you and do hope to see you again sometime soon.

Thanks for taking the time to give us your feedback on your most recent stay with us.  I am happy that you enjoyed our lobby, the breakfast area and found our staff to be pleasant and friendly!

If they see a Do Not Disturb sign on the door past 1 pm, they assume that the guests do not want service ( unless something is set up with the front desk ahead of time).  What is unacceptable to me is that you felt that your room was not vacuumed properly nor the sheets changed.  That is a huge NO NO in my book!

You had mentioned that you felt the hotel is not \"modern\" and I just wanted to let you know that we have designed the hotel in a British Colonial theme on purpose!  It is unique in its appearance and being so close to the Islands and the cruise terminal, we designed the hotel a little different than your standard Hampton.  We do not have a phone board at the airport nor does the Port Everglades cruise port offer them.  Most of our international guests are investing in a small prepaid cell phone(which I would personally recommend for anyone traveling outside their country for their safety anyway) for situations just like this.  It does get a little busy at the port when there are multiple ships coming in on the same day and all hotels go through the challenge of picking up guests that are coming in all at once.  We do our very best to get everyone picked up and back to the hotel as soon as humanly possible.

Most guests LOVE our Flamingos!     I do apologize that you felt the wait was a little longer than we told you it would be.  We do our very best to get our guests picked up in a timely fashion at the cruise port ( just remember....there are usually thousands of folks trying to do the same thing at the same time!)  30 to 45 minutes is not an unreasonable time to be picked up by our complimentary shuttle service and probably that is what most guests should expect on busy cruise weekends.  My apologies that we gave you a shorter time, sometimes we think we can get there in that timeframe only to be stalled by the lines getting into the port or held up by the cruise port itself.   We actually do have 3 vans that we run at a time and believe me....they are ALL running on busy weekends!  I also apologize for your wait to check in.  If you arrive at the hotel after a cruise and we are full the night before(which is the case most weekends) , we have to wait for current in house guests to check out, get the room clean and inspect it....THEN we can give it to you. Official check in time is 3pm- if you arrive at the hotel at 8:00am or 9:00am after a cruise there is a pretty good chance you will have to wait 4 or 5 hours before we can get a room for you.  We will be happy to store your luggage while you go next door in the plaza and grab breakfast or lunch, or you can take a cab to the beach or to Los Olas to shop!

There is only one specific place that the Fort Lauderdale airport will allow our drivers to pick up passengers in each terminal- at the \"Hotel Off Aiport Parking\" area.  There is a blue sign in each terminal letting guests know where they go to be picked up by hotel shuttles.

If you were in the wrong place to be picked up, he should have directed you to the right place and waited for you to get there.   My sincere apologies that he made you feel bad.

It even offers free transport to restaurants and shopping within a couple of miles of the hotel.   When I was there, it was filled to capacity with cruisers coming and going.

I booked through their website and used the CAA rate which was $143.10US which is definitely worth every penny. Shuttle service, free breakfast, huge clean rooms. The plaza next door was great for last minute things like water, pop, and there is also a liquor store.  We also ordered in for dinner from the Dough Boys which was great. The portions were huge and the price very reasonable.

I felt like I was in Hilton or Embassy Suites, rather than just a regular Hampton Inn.  Free internet computer usage in the lobby, breakfast \"to go\" bags if you are in a hurry.  Wonderful!

I highly recommend this hotel, if for nothing else, the free shuttle service.  My flight had been delayed for arrival due to a storm so it was very late when I arrived.  The guy driving the shuttle was so personalbe and friendly.  He even went thru a McDonalds drive-thru so I could get a bite to eat.  Upon my return, another driver was also very personable and friendly.  He offered to take us to town in the shuttle after noon since he wouldn't have many runs until later.  Front desk staff was also very friendly.  There is a very nice pool and I felt very safe.  My only complaint was the selection for the complimentary continental breakfast.  I've been to other hotels that have had a bigger selection.

This seems to be a popular choice because the hotel was full of people doing exactly what we were.  When we arrived at the airport we used the courtesy phone to call the shuttle and were told that a large group had called prior to us and that there would be approximately a half-hour wait until there would be room in one of the shuttle vans for us.  We decided to wait rather than take a taxi as we didn't have any other plans.  We watched as the shuttle made several round trips picking up the large group that was ahead of us and dropping them at the hotel before returning for more.

They offered us a conference room where they had rolled in a pull out couch.  Totally unacceptable of course.  They couldn't find another room in other Hampton Inns, everyone was booked.  Finally found us a room at the Marriott ($80 more expensive) and refused to pay for it.  We had no choice but to pay for it ourselves.  The desk boy and manager were rude and unsympathetic.

The service was excellent!  The room was quite large and roomy.  We loved the bed and the over abundance of pillows!  They offered free shuttle service to/from the airport and to/from the cruise port!  We also stayed post cruise and were very pleased that they remembered us!
