[{"title": "Nice to come back to", "review": "Have just returned home from 9 lovely nights at the Amari. Love the renovations and pool areas which is a vast improvement from previously. Would like to especially thank Pear for your assistance in helping us upgrade to a Executive Club room. All our previous stays have been in club rooms and would highly recommend. Love the look of the Club lounge and makes it more spacious. Thank you to Apple and all the lovely ladies in the lounge area for there special treatment and you are all such a huge asset to the hotel. Many thanks to the breakfast, cleaning and pool staff for your very friendly interaction. We understand that the hotel is focusing on a more family environment and that is good as I feel Pattaya is becoming more known for this rather than the sleaze of many years ago. Makes it more interesting to visit every year. But I am going to refer to a comment from Vicvladb from a review on 3/11 also from Melbourne. Please do not forget about your repeat customers that have enjoyed coming back year on year. As a couple we have enjoyed the atmosphere, staff and location of this hotel. But on the weekends the kids area/main pool gets over run from ex-pat families etc coming down for the wkend. You get the kids jumping from there area into the big pool and you cannot move for inflatable toys and kids screaming. This is where you need to improve with an adults ONLY area. The front lawn is being highly un utilised to its full potential, I am not interested in a sitting space, look at what The Holiday Inn next door has. The new restaurant will be fantastic and I am sure that will work for the hotel. But you need an Adults only beach club(like they have in Bali and Fiji) with cabanas and pool. You will lose people like us - couples that stay for 9-10 days every year and enjoy there quiet spaces and not having to put noise canceling headphones on. This was your high season, but also very quiet. I would hate to think what it would be like during very busy periods. We would consider staying elsewhere on our next visit if tourism has picked up as we like to have that balance of kids space and adult areas. Thank you for a lovely break.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293919-d6390812-r728252899", "sub_review": {"Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Superb hotel !

Disadvantage is that the beach road is 5km long and the Central shopping mall is 2,5km away in the centre of the beach road and walking street, is on the southern end of the beach road, which is quite a walk away. But on the plus side, for me the location is a positive because it is away from the noisy bars and clubs and has a real peaceful feel to the place as you can mostly only hear the jetskis and boats in the ocean across the road.

The Amari was great for us. We were 2 adults & 2 kids (6 & 13) and reserved the regular twin bed room. Upon arrival the check in process takes too long as they make copies of all passports etc. When we walk into our room, we spotted the extremely narrow twin beds, which seems more like 2 single beds. I returned to the front desk and told them about the beds that can't accommodate 2 persons at any way. They immediately upgraded us to a family room! No questions asked and with a smile. Very friendly and helpful! Our family room was a blast. The girls loved it. The room was big and had a 2 twin beds that we converted to a king..

Local transport services drove around the main areas in a circle so you could hop on/off whenever you feel like it. We upgraded to business class which was the BEST thing ever! They had a \"happy hour\" between 5 and 6 on the business class floor which meant all drinks were free and they also provided canopes. We basically had our meal and drinks for free every night before we went out to explore Pattaya! It saved us so much money!  We weren't supposed to have our beach wear on for this so they even let us sneak a few drinks back to the room one night when we were late getting back!
