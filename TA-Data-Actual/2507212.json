The hotel is 6 stories with 2 rooms on each floor and the lobby is just a desk in the entrance right next to the breakfast area (I will never call it a buffet) The staff are very friendly but don't let this fool you, as behind these wonderful smiles there is a terrible customer experience.  Let's start with the rooms. They are fairly spacious compared to other rooms in istanbul small hotels, BUT, there is a major hygiene problem. The closets were dirty and had food crumbs and hair in them. There were ants in the toilet and last but not least, a used underwear stuffed between the wall and the nightstand (BIG EEEEW) The beds were hard and extremely uncomfortable. The rest of the furniture was old and rundown. Owner is  extremely rude and greedy. I cancelled my stay after 1 night stay although I lost 350 USD for it. Terrible hotel. They didn\u2019t even want to give me back my money until I threatened them by calling  police I totally warn anyone against this hotel as it is the manifestation of the word (looks can be deceiving) and by that I mean the lovey pics you will see on the booking sites. \u2026", "date": "December 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2507212-r644213117", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Good location", "review": "We stayed in La Piano hotel for 5 nights and it was great.
