Asked about air con, was told no it doesn\u2019t work, asked about fan, (it was 28 degrees) was told I was not pressing the right switch, so asked could they show me where it was. He came up, pressed the same switch I had, nothing, glanced across the room and said, you have a window, open it. Asked if the fan could be fixed tomorrow he said yes of course, wasn\u2019t fixed for my entire stay. Next morning I had 23 mosquito bites. Too far out of the centre for the price.

People at the reception were always very nice and helpful - good tips for neighbouring restaurants which being a little out of the way actually becomes a bonus.  Great places offering wonderful food and a very reasonable prices - but ask at reception!  Breakfast - continental was Ok for us.

Not a big deal, we normally travel this way for a couple of reasons, one is price and the other is, well, travel. Downtowns never really give you an adequate picture of the people and places you\u2019re visiting. Anyway. This seemed like one of those places that was going to be a gem, but I had reservations. Reviews seemed mixed and sometimes negative reviews can sound harsher than they should be. We\u2019ll start at the beginning, we arrived and were greeted by the one friendly staff person. As is customary, they ask for your keys when you leave. The keys are old fashioned, and the room safe has a cute old fashioned key as well. The hotel lobby is small, the elevator is small and warm and slow. The stairs run through the center of the building and provide a little quicker access for about the same amount of sweat. The room had 3 single beds in it, two were together (pretty standard) but there wasn\u2019t much in the way of \u201croom\u201d other than those three beds. The bathroom was the standard \u201cafterthought\u201d style including the bidet, there is no tub, just a curtain you pull around yourself between the toilet and bidet\u2026. It wasn\u2019t particularly cute, or clean, or charming in any way. There are not a lot of electrical sockets to choose from, so we had to locate some to power phones/computers. Which brings us to internet, it was free and not hard to get on. The area was fairly quiet. The room is stuffy, but that comes with a cost in summertime. With the fresh air of open windows comes the mosquitos, pick your poison. Travelling back and forth to downtown is not a big deal at all. Super easy, take the 17 into town and the 17C coming back.  The bus system can get you anywhere in Florence and we suggest using it. One really cool thing was the market in the morning on the way to the bus stop. Great produce and meats. Breakfast was mediocre, everything was store bought and put on plates. One other item is the coffee is not free outside of breakfast time. Overall I would say pass on this unless you are just looking for a cheap place to lay your head.\u2026", "date": "May 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d258609-r582337302", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Rooms": 3, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled on business", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Good for the budget traveller", "review": "Santa Maria Novella train station welcomes the majority of the people arriving in Florence, which might explain the hectic pace.
