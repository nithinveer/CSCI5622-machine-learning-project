[{"title": "6.0   Going downhill, sadly. Not up to 5 stars!", "review": "This is an historic building in a wonderful mountain setting. The food is excellent, with large portions and the restaurant has great views during daylight hours. There is a built-in music system in the lounge, bathroom & bedroom, which is a lovely touch. The sound quality is good too. The bed is comfortable. There is a log fire in the lounge, which is ready for you to light, if it gets cold. The scenery is wonderful and the location very good for visiting Antequera, The Torcals & Lobo Parque. The male receptionist was poor on our arrival, and was not friendly or welcoming. However, the lady on our departure was very friendly. There was a long wait for the bar steward, who eventually turned up, got us 2 drinks, then quickly disappeared. The waiter service was very poor on our 2nd night, forgetting our bread, appetizers & to light our candle. They too were not friendly. As a light bulb was not working in our room, I fetched one from reception & put it in myself. This is supposed to be a five star hotel. Why do the maids never check if all of the lighting works? All of the lampshades were burnt, due to having the wrong bulbs in them. The restaurant did not open on time, so I sat down, and the arm fell off the chair! The Wi-Fi was patchy, dropping out occasionally. The toilet paper is disgustingly thin and cheap. There was no free water or chocolate or turn down service. We booked a double bed, but got 2 x single beds, made up separately, and pushed together! The sound insulation is very poor. You can hear people walking, moving etc. very clearly.\u2026", "date": "September 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g315910-d1202227-r716340210", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Great place", "review": "Dear LuxuryExplorer01 ,  Your vision is the key to complete the satisfaction of our guests, and we are very grateful for your valuable time in leaving your comment on Tripadvisor.

The sauna didn't work and the steam room was cold.   The bed rooms where clean and comfortable. But in our bathroom the walk in shower had no shower head holder. The plugs in both sinks and bath did not work.
