Although it is clean it is very small with one bedside draw and one unit with no doors on which is for hanging your clothes up on. As you can appreciate the amount of clothes for 2 weeks is a lot more than 2/3 nights stay. The bathroom again clean but no space to put any utilities on such as shower gel, toiletries, makeup etc. Which leaves the bathroom looking untidy. Shower gel was left on the first day then never replaced. No safe to put passports or any other valuables in. All in all a very disappointing stay. I did email booking.com a number of times to complain and they did get on to the manager who offered us another room but it was more expensive than the room we were already in. A week later offered another room at no further expense which I agreed to take. However when we came back on the Friday it was never mentioned and the wife was not seen again until the day we were leaving. The annoying thing was that the manager spoke very little English however she spoke very good English. Quite a few concerns with this Hostal no roof terrace, no breakfast, no safe although they have a garden it is not very clean the sun lounger is broken and it looks as if it the staff uses the garden room to hang washing out. Minus theses few facilities added an extra cost of 168 euros for breakfasts plus 112 euros for sun lounger so taken into account this added cost it was a very expensive stay.   \u2026", "date": "September 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g315917-d608295-r714697208", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Great Location, lovely clean rooms, great hospitality", "review": "I have stayed here now 3 times, with children and without, and each time, the rooms have been fantastic, always clean with air con, all amenities including towels, complimentary shampoo, body wash, tea and coffee.

I was therefore very pleased to have a very relaxing and peaceful time staying at Hostal Abril for five nights. My room was small but very clean and very well appointed. The bathroom and shower area had obviously been recently refurbished and had an excellent shower.The bed in my room was also one of the best on this trip, very comfortable. I stayed at two other self catering apartments in Torre Del Mar and Malaga the previous nine nights and found that the beds were very uncomfortable. Despite my room facing on to the main road traffic noise was not a problem and stopped reasonably early.  The Hostal is close to the Balcon de Europa approx 15 minutes walk and extremely handy for the taxi rank and kiosk for bus tickets (Alsa). Nerja has many cafes, restaurants all very close to the Hostal Abril.  I was surpised to find that my room was cleaned every day with towels replaced regularly, I was not expecting this in this type of accomodation. The room had a small fridge and kettle for teamaking. The staff were also very helpful (Montse) and helped with local information etc. I was asked if I required towels for the beach upon arrrival, I thought that this was a good touch. The only problems that I encountered were that no lift is available in the property therefore customers with mobility issues may have problems . This was not a problem for me a I dislike lifts. Another top tip would be for customers to have some knowledge of the Spanish language.  I recommend staying here and hope to return next spring.\u2026", "date": "June 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g315917-d608295-r682244149", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled solo", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Hostal Abril, May 2019", "review": "We chose to stay at this Hostal for a second time in May 2019.
