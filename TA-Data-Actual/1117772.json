The coach trip from the airport was a long hour and a half, but when we arrived at the Hotel it was worth the journey.  The Hotel staff are all very friendly and if they couldn't speak English, we all muddled through.  The rooms were large and open and airy.  We had a room looking out onto the beach bar and the waiters even brought drinks over in the late afternoon while I was sitting out on my balcony.  All support staff were fantastic and they were all very friendly and helpful.  The food is beyond belief.  My husband complained most days at the evening meal as he couldn't try ALL the food on offer as there was just\u2026", "date": "June 2011", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3736153-d1117772-r115674791", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "A piece of heaven affordable and possible staff and managers helpful beyond words", "review": "Handicapped rooms bought us eya been to monster Tunisia many times but this hotel saphir palms zarzis is the best fab rooms spacious good Ramps door widths  The staffs and managers are great helpful and very interested in your wellbeing in there care all fun around the pool yes there are not many English but the fun was we all Mixed with each other I think that's a good holiday so English only speakers it's not a problem the ones who speak all languages soon help you this is prober Tunisia very remote granted but you can visit towns and djerba not far by taxi etc  It's closer to the sahara trip the entertainment in this small hotel is superb none less than too the larger hotels we recommend this holiday as 100 percent value and enjoyment for money will defo go back again the\u2026", "date": "July 2011", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3736153-d1117772-r115424235", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Lovely hotel and beach but outdated evening entertainment", "review": "Tunisia is a closed currency and the hotel only changes \u00a320 notes - no other money  and you need to hand over the equivalent of \u00a310 deposit for each beach towel so beware as there is no bank nearby.

Momo, Titi, Joseph, Alex, Rico, Coco, Mimi, Mady and Touna were all fab!!!  The lads got you dancing in the evenings which was great and were just as entertaining by day.

The water stopped almost every evening and this was also a problem. We didn\u00b4t get the room we booked and the reception was not well organized.

You will probably be proposed a better couscous with extra charge of 14 euros per person, but we were said that it wasn't that better.
