We do not answer the comments in this web, neither the positives nor the negatives. But in this affair, and following the instructions of the lawyer of the company, we understand that we must make an exception for the seriousness of your accusations. As we informed you by email, on Monday 13 February. Our hotels facilities comply with all regulations required by the law in Spain and were carried out by companies certified by the Ministry of Industry. We also sent you the Installation work document, of the apartment where you stayed, signed and stamped by an inspector, stating the following: \u201cThe distributor responsible for commissioning the installation certifies that the tests and checks indicated by the current regulations have been carried out, that the result of them is correct and that the installation is in service, so this document will constitute the certificate of pre-tests and commissioning of the installation.\u201d The following Thursday of your stay and due to your calls, we received an inspection of Gas Natural Fenosa, the service provider. In this inspection the technician checked both the installation and the boiler of the apartment where you stayed, being correct in both cases. The inspector also took measurements of the filtered Co in the apartment with the boiler in use, the result of which is 0 parts per million. Therefore, the accusations made by you are false and may constitute a crime. We inform you that we reserve our right to initiate the relevant legal actions. Sincerely  Estimada Sra.

Tambi\u00e9n se le envi\u00f3 el parte de instalaci\u00f3n del apartamento donde se aloj\u00f3, que viene firmado y sellado por un inspector, donde se indica lo siguiente: \u201cEl distribuidor responsable de la puesta en servicio de la instalaci\u00f3n, certifica que han sido efectuadas las pruebas y comprobaciones indicadas por la reglamentaci\u00f3n vigente, que el resultado de las mismas es correcto y que la instalaci\u00f3n queda en disposici\u00f3n de servicio, por lo que este documento pasa a constituir el certificado de pruebas previas y puesta en servicio de la instalaci\u00f3n\u201d.  El jueves siguiente a su estancia con nosotros y debido a sus llamadas, recibimos una inspecci\u00f3n de Gas Natural Fenosa, proveedor del servicio. En esta inspecci\u00f3n el t\u00e9cnico comprob\u00f3 tanto la instalaci\u00f3n como el calentador del apartamento donde se aloj\u00f3, siendo correcto en ambos casos. Dicho inspector tambi\u00e9n tom\u00f3 medidas del Co filtrado dentro del apartamento estando el calentador en funcionamiento, siendo el resultado del mismo de 0 partes por mill\u00f3n.

During the busy season I suspect there would be a lack of sun beds and they really do need to put parasols up as the heat was very strong and this is dangerous.

There are just under 100 apartments with about 300 guests here and 2 swimming pools but only 31 sun beds in total and hardly any parasols!!   There was virtually no chance of getting one, let alone 3 for my wife, daughter and I. This meant you were on the hard standing or grass next to the pool with no shade at all in the 33 degree heat of August. For us this is our whole holiday and we were not able to complete it. We moved to a villa with pool further up the coast.

We booked directly with the hotel for two nights, and although there were only two of us, they put us into a two-bedroom apartment (not sure if the one-bed ones were all taken), at 100 euro a night including breakfast. Now, I'd not have complained too much if our accommodation ended at the bedroom door (which included an en-suite shower room), but we also got another bedroom, a bathroom, a utility room, a kitchen, a dining room, a living room, a large terrace with cane furniture, and because we were on the top floor, a staircase up to our own roof terrace!
