We were sorely disappointed. We stayed at three hotels during our trip to Italy--one in Venice, one in Rome, and this one in Florence. This one was the most of expensive of the three, and yet it was the only one where our stay was not enjoyable. The ONLY pro is delicious breakfast on the roof. Don't bother with the dinner restaurant there. When we first checked in, they gave us a handicap room, so we had them change us to a normal room. The beds were hard, the WiFi connection was weak. The tub in the cramped bathroom was surrounded by rotting wood and cracked tiles. Two light bulbs were out, the air conditioning was weak, and the fridge didn't work.

The rooms are comfortable and Italian so not an English style 4 star hotel standard but I have no complaints.
