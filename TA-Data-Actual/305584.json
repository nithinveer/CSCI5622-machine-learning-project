[{"title": "Great Location to visit Barcelona", "review": "We stayed here as part of a Gate One tour.  It is located in a nice area close to everything (La Sagrada Familia, old town, Cathedral of the Sea, etc.)  The breakfast buffet was very good and I loved the Tumeric Latte they had and very good house made yogurt.  After the tour, we booked another night as we were going on to Bilbao and the Basque country after the tour concluded.  We had a couple of hiccups on this front.  First, we got locked out of our room the day the tour ended even though we had the next night booked and paid for.  Second, our room booking for the extra night came with late check out (15:00) and a bottle of Cava and chocolates.  They delivered the Cava and chocolates at 23:30 hours, when we were asleep. Then, we got locked out again the next day before checking out even though we had paid 30 euro for a 15:00 check out.  I was  disappointed that it didn't work out better and that we had to stress about the check out.  However, the staff were pleasant and friendly and I walked all over using the hotel as a base.  We did laundry, visited Antoni Guadi sites on a walking tour, and La Sagrada Familia all very easily with Google maps. I can't say I'd recommend this hotel again, as I don't know what else is out there, but it was clean and convenient.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d305584-r727119494", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Quiet hotel with everything close by", "review": "Thank you so much!!!

There was a \"master switch\" by the door than was switched by dropping your room key into it. I think the idea was that you grabbed your key on the way out to ensure that you did not leave any lights on. Unfortunately, the AC also turned off when you did this, so the room was quite warm upon returning. 2. Our king-size bed was just two twins pushed together. Both beds were made up individually, so it wasn't really like sleeping in one bed. 3.

Our room looked over an interior courtyard - and with blackout blinds it was still a bit light in our room. I can't believe ANYONE one would say that the beds were comfortable - they were like sleeping on the floor - and the pillows were like rocks!
