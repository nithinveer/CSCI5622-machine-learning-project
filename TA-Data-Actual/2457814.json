Wifi available throughout the hotel. Breakfast was good - egg bar was the highlight. A fresh omelette every day if you wanted.

We usually go to Patong the party capital of Phuket. However Pattaya is different, totally different.

Also that you hand your towels in the bathroom, meaning no change requested. Also the Room maids does not enter the room in case the \"Do Not disturb\" sign is pressed. As per arrival information and in our Guest directory we ask the guests to inform our front office in case there is any specif time the guest want to have the room cleaned so we can make the schedule accordingly. In our log books we do not have any records that you been in contact with us about any of these comments.

I am sorry to see this. Please allow me to apologize directly to you for this. I would like , however to clarify a few points. 1. The dress code for the pool is clearly sign posted at pool entry. 2. Showers are available next the pool and also clearly sign posted. 3. The pool is perfectly cleaned on a daily basis. The water is very clear and tested daily. 4. As you can see in other reviews our breakfast is very well received by all our guests. Our Restaurant Manager spent considerable time with you to ensure your eggs were catered for.  5. You can also see that there are no complaints from any other guest regarding air-conditioning noise although I will admit that sometimes the equipment can fail and we will room move any guest who is inconvenienced. 6. We are indeed a four star product and not of the same standard as some of the more expensive 5 star hotels. We don't claim otherwise. 7. The tour desk and Spa pricing is very competitive in the market place of Pattaya and on many occasions cheaper than other comparative hotels. I am hopeful that some of my feedback can clarify some of the issues for you. We do strive to keep all our guests happy and comfortable!!

The beach is a short 7-10 min walk away.  2) Most popular fast food dining outlets like McD, Burger King, P Hut etc are nearby. 3) Its almost on 2nd Road, which is very lively.
