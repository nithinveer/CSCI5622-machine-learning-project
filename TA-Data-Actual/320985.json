Our room was at ground level, not the utmost for privacy as you'll need to keep curtains closed most of the time.   Staff is very nice and helpful.

Maree was the most helpful, she not only gave us a bus & train timetable, but organised taxi's from Granollers to get us home when we got stranded in montmelo.

At least the car was still there when we got back.  It was 3.90 Euros return and took us to the downtown and all the metro stops in half an hour. The hotel is within walking distance of a restaurant and a gas station which has a very large selection of food including pagaged lettuce.
