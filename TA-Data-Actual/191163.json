The building itself was originally a convent of the 15th century and then converted into a hotel, so it\u2019s quite normal to have rooms different from each other. Of course it\u2019s quite impossible to put all the pictures of all the 21 rooms on the website. Whenever a guest is not happy with his room, we try our best to give an alternative one however this of course will depend on our availability. Your complain arrived on the second day of your stay and that particular day, we had just a couple of rooms available. The hotel staff informed you that it was no more possible to make a second change as another Deluxe room was not available. The availability that you saw online was for different categories.  The fact that you don\u2019t like rooms number 4 or 20 is your personal opinion and we respect it but it\u2019s not nice to recommend other guests not to book them. We have many returning guests when  usually make their reservation, ask for these rooms to be assigned them. All the rooms are equipped with antique furnitures (not old) and concerning the bath of being too high, well it\u2019s a normal bathtub with normal/standard dimensions. The purpose of offering you a bottle of spumante was not done in the hope to avoid any written complain\u2026... This was specially requested by your travel agent.  Our main goal is to make our guests happy, by making them feel comfortable, by offering full assistance, service, and respect. If a guest has an issue, the staff is here purposely to listen and give assistance as soon as possible. A client is always right but still he has to give respect towards the other person to whom he is talking. If someone will shout to a lady staff, asking her to make continuous repetitions (as a student) of everything that he was \u201csaying\u201d, of course for us that person is rude.  Finally the manager was not making any kind of interruptions while your were talking...It\u2019s normal that he has to give a reply or explanation after each comment that you were pointing out otherwise we will not get any conclusion if he just remains in silence\u2026...  Thank you for your attention and kind regards.

All the attractions of Florence are within a 15mins walk and it feels less busy than in the centre of town where most of the hotels are located.

I ordered a bouquet of roses for my partner to be in the room on arrival and they turned out to be the largest long stemmed red roses I had ever seen. Staff also made great restaurant recommendation.

The rooms are individually decorated and the air-conditioning is a must in the summer months. Be warned about the mosquitoes which are ubiquitous throughout Florence, and ensure that the plug-in insect repellent the hotel provides is on throughout the day.

The bathroom was very nicely done: clean, sleek, modern, and roomy.  The neighborhood is authentically Florentine, set away from the big tourist draws but close enough to walk to them easily.

The J&J is located on a quiet street, yet close to pretty much everything.  We were able to walk virtually everywhere in Florence that we wanted to go.

The TV is upstairs in the bedroom rather than downstairs in the sitting area. But the biggest problem is that this ground floor room looks out on to the communal courtyard and the breakfast room.
