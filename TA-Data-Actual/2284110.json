[{"title": "Wonderful setting, hard if you're on your own", "review": "As per the other reviews, Shanti Som has an amazing location in the hills of Andalusia, the facility is beautiful and very well put together, the yoga and personal trainer classes are amazing, and the pool was glorious for November. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I came as a solo traveller and after reading the advertising about the shared table for solo travellers in the dining area and the info about most of the visitors being solo travellers. Upon arrival, I found I was the only solo traveller, alongside one couple and a group retreat of about 12-14 people who had come as solo travellers to join one of the centre's week long programmes. In the dining area, I was seated a table by myself during my three night stay whilst the people on the structured retreat shared a table and fun conversation each mealtime on a long table next to me. It was a lonely experience and one evening they invited me to join them, but the following evening they were busy in a party so I sat and ate by myself whilst the people on the next table played games and had a great time. On checking out, I was told by several of the staff that there were 'normally' other solo travellers but not the week I was there.  It would perhaps have been tactful of the staff to ask me if I was happy to eat alone whilst watching a group of other visitors socialise together, after all, we were all individuals who came for the same reasons. The food although tasty give me a bad stomach one evening, and the couple had a bad experience with some raw chicken which left them sleepless and unhappy for most of their stay. I had one joint yoga class with the female and gave her a hug as she cried into my arms at how unwell she felt. That said, the staff are lovely and go out of their way to speak with you personally. So a mixed bag. I think this would be a wonderful place to come with a friend or family member but not alone.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1080297-d2284110-r724654057", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 4}, {"title": "4th visit and still wonderful", "review": "Dear Katya, thank you so much for publishing your impressions about Shanti Som on TriAdvisor.
