After reading your comments I would like to some remarks about them, as I am afraid you got the wrong information when you booked in your Travel Agency and your expectations did not match with the holiday you bought.   Sunna Park has two different destinations:  a four-star Hotel, which one is divided in two buildings  (128 rooms)  and three-key Apartment complex, with also two buildings (52 Apts.) Both share  the same reception. In your case, you have booked an Apartment in our Three Keys Apartments and the reception is located at the Hotel, so you had to go to another building. The Apartments were not even in the same building, as the reception desk, because the reception desk is in the Hotel as the majority of the rooms. The distance between the reception and your apartment was less than 100m and the Apartments themselves, are close to the Hotel.   The cleaning service in the Hotel is every single day and in the Apartments is every day except Wednesdays and Sundays.( as per contract)    Regarding  the snacks, is right, we open the Snack Bar from 01.06 till 30.09, but we do offer snacks at the main Restaurant from 26.04 till 31.05 and from 01.10 till 31.10.         We have guests from different countries, although is true that most of them are coming from Germany, the guests are our priority, independently where they come from and all the Staff and myself, we always  try  to do our best in order to give them the best service in all the outlets in Sunna Park.
