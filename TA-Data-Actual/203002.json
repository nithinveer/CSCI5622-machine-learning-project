I was visiting Florence over the weekend and had booked a one-night stay. In my effort to stay close to Roma Termini station, I ended up choosing a very poor location for sightseeing as the public transport was very unreliable. I was allowed to check-in and drop off my bags one hour before scheduled check-in time. The room was on the roof and had a very odd configuration, probably the result of being an attic converted to a hotel room. The AC was barely having any effect, as a result. That was the first red flag. I left for my explorations without thinking much about it.   When I returned back, around 10:30 PM, I discovered LIVE BUGS on both of the beds. There was no lack of diversity as they were different kinds. I promptly took photos and called in the manager. On his first appearance, he perfectly portrayed the role of an innocent, aghast manager who was unaware of the failings of the cleaning staff and as if this was the first ever occurrence. That part was untrue as I later discovered in other reviews. He also apologized for the pathetic excuse of an AC, promised me a room change and went downstairs to make arrangements. Meanwhile I was trying to channel my inner chakras so as to be able to levitate and not touch the carpet.   He called after 30 minutes and offered me fresh bedsheets as the promised room wasn't available. All my frustrated ramblings fell to deaf ears. While waiting for his arrival with bed sheets, I started frantically searching for hotels nearby. Unfortunately, it was around 11:30 PM already and nothing was available. I resigned to my fate. The manager came back with the sheets and seemed reluctant to perform the task of changing them as it was beneath his vaunted pay grade of night manager of a rundown bug-dump. Eventually he relented and changed the sheets. He left promising to make a note and alert the morning manager to offer me a compensation for my \"inconvenience\".   For the next two hours, I  tried to use my phone's flashlight (as the room was dimly lit) to turn over the mattresses and thoroughly search for signs of an infestation. The mattresses had dark stains on the underside. Finally, exhausted and having somehow convinced myself of the inevitability of the situation, I choose to turn in for the night.   The breakfast was mostly thawed out frozen bakery items. While checking out, the morning manager was completely unaware of my situation. The valiant night manager who went above and beyond his duty to change the sheets had apparently fallen short on his promise. Anyway, the new manager expressed his regret for not being able to help me right away as it was a prepaid reservation. He asked me to contact the travel agency in two weeks to check on my compensation. I have traveled enough to see through the ruse. And right fully so, it has been a week since I started my inquiry through the travel agency and no inroads have been made on the compensation front. I'm quite sure the morning manager forgot to make a note of my inconvenience as well.   In short, STAY THE HELL AWAY from this nightmare of a hotel. \u2026", "date": "July 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d203002-r689206884", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Worst Hotel in Italy!", "review": "Santa Maria Novella train station welcomes the majority of the people arriving in Florence, which might explain the hectic pace.

It was a nice hotel, but you had to take a bus to see any attractions in Florence. The back of the hotel was next to a school so it was very loud in the day, but very quiet at night. The room was clean and the bathroom had lots of room. The lady who ran the breakfast room was a little rude. The front desk all spoke english and was helpful with the bus system. Great hotel if your alright with catching very crowded buses everyday.

Upon arriving back in Florence, we walked about 20 minutes from the train station, getting to the Hotel at about 10 p.m.  The concierge kindly called and got us a late night reservation at a local and fantastic restaurant a few blocks away.  He also arranged for an early (5:45 a.m.) taxi to the airport.  The quad room was sort of small, but it was perfect for us our last night.  We'd recommend the place for sure.  We can't tell you about breakfast because we left too early! The staff was great.

The hotel was a 20 minute walk from the train station and about 30 minutes walk to the city center.  The staff was helpful and professional.  Our room (#215) was large and clean and one of the few rooms with a balcony. Because the hotel is further out from the city center, the room and balcony were quiet and it was relaxing.  The breakfast is served in a nice room in the basement and includes rolls, cheese, ham, cappuccino and yogurt.  There is internet access on one computer in the lobby area for 4 Euro for 30 minutes.  The negative to the hotel would be that it is a longer walk to get to the main sights.

The rooms were clean and the staff extremely helpful and kind.
