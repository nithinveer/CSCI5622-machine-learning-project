The evening meal is buffet style and was OK but nothing special, breakfast much the same. Nothing to complain about, but is the sort you could visit anywhere in the world. The hotel has a paid parking garage, but you can park for free on the road directly outside.

The food was excellent with plenty of choice, and with the option of eating on the patio, which was peaceful and secluded. All the staff were friendly and the bar never too busy. Everything is within walking distance, including the beach which is only five minutes away, and the centre which is no more than ten.  The Donana is one of the few four star hotels in Sanluccar and certainly deserves the designation. The room was clean and spacious, with a good sized balcony, although the sea view was partly blocked by a sports centre.The beds were really comfortable, with little or no noise from the hotel or outside.

Parking is free and easy outside the hotel and the hotel is situated a short walk from the excellent fish restaurants on the river nearby.  We asked for ice for the room from the bar and this was provided without a problem.  Good to bring in to the hotel a bottle of the local Manzanilla sherry and enjoy it on the balcony of your room.

Although the web site states that it is near restaurants and bars, it isn\u2019t!   It is certainly situated very close to the beach but the surroundings leave a lot to be desired.   It is a good 20 min. walk into the old town, which is great.   Our hotel room was clean enough, with a balcony overlooking the pool, but it was purely functional.   The towels in the room were quite threadbare and, although obviously washed, looked as though they had seen better days.
