[{"title": "need major improvement ", "review": "srated here 4 weeks, this being my last week. My opinion is they need a lot of improvement. I wanted to extend my stay for 8 more weeks but now just want to check out 1. the Wi-Fi is sad, I complaint on multiple occasions and send aims to the manager who helped with my booking but no response ever. 2. yesterday the power just went off in morning and nothing was functioning ..AC, tv, elevator...for about an hour. I mean this is supposed to be a hotel , right? 3. today at 9 pm...there is no water in  the bathroom....so I called the reception, someone came checked and then no response. I called again to enquire....after sometime reception called to say there is a problem with the main line and it will only be fixed tomorrow morning.....wow! and for the night and morning shower i can use the bathroom in the sauna area....i am on 3rd floor and sauna is on -1. The least i would have expected is for them to change my room for the night.   this is one unthinkable place with zero sense of service   there are other improvement such as rh3 furniture is all worn-off , see pictures. Housekeeping will keep knocking your room inspire of Do not disturb sign on. Once they did not bother to pick laundery bag for flat 3 days inspire of me keeping it in the laundery bag, with the form on the bed.   take my advise, stay away from this place. \u2026", "date": "September 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2514740-r523205640", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled on business", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Work & holiday", "review": " Mood design hotel is great.Rooms are clean.Staff are very kind and hospitabale.Breakfast is amazing(Famous Turkish breakfast).The hotel's location is great and near subway.I strongly suggest this hotel to people   who want to have a great and safe trip in Istanbul.", "date": "March 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2514740-r468222247", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "\"Luxury Hotel\"", "review": "Stayed at this hotel for five days four nights, the whole it experience was amazing from start to finish.

The lighting is not so great. The low lighting is part of the design of each room but I would have preferred a lot more light.  Breakfast is what you would expect from a boutique hotel, not lavish but with majority of expected items to hand, such as toast, cereal, selection of croissants and some hot dishes. They serve freshly pressed orange juice that tastes great.  The reception staff are fantastic. They really go out of their way to help and have good local knowledge of where to go and what to do.

The hotel is located in a part of town that is not very attractive for tourists. There is nothing in the area as a point of interest for a tourist, you need to go to other parts of town to have your sightseeing experience. For business purposes, its proximity to the 4. Levent metro is a plus. It is very close and convenient. The hotel is in a narrow side street and rooms have no view just the across apartments on the other side of the street. The street is quite deserted at night but well lit so I had no problem coming back late at night. I think the downside of the location is that it is in a business area and none of the apartment buildings seemed to be accommodated by residents. While walking down the street I thought, if someone grabs my bag, nobody would hear me screaming. I understand that this is not the hotel's problem but I felt a bit insecure as a woman walking down that street, just saying. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The interior design is following a bit of a royalty style with rich colours and elaborate designed furnishings. My couch had a tear on its seat, I don't know what cause it, but I could see the stuffing inside. The bathroom had all the amenities and spacious. Only downside was that the bathtub had black moldy sections at the corners. If you get irritated by those kind of details, this room would make you feel uncomfortable. For me it was ok for two nights. The moldy corners made me think that most probably they used cheap material and it didn't last long.  The staff at the reception and the breakfast room were great. Very thorough, helpful and attentive. I would call it excellent. Breakfast was very nicely laid out with rich ingredients, buffet style. I enjoyed tasting various different kinds of delicious cheeses, olives, jams, hot and cold dishes. The staff at the breakfast area were very helpful and professional, too. They have a ready made coffee machine, no filter coffee. But delicious tea! Overall this has not been my very best stay ever but given a two day trip in Istanbul, it was OK.\u2026", "date": "February 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2514740-r459606893", "sub_review": {"Value": 3, "Cleanliness": 3, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled on business", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Great Hotel, bad view, not so good location", "review": "I stayed three nights in this hotel and I won't regret it.
