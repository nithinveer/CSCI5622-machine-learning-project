The GalleryONE Double Tree has three redeeming qualities: the front desk staff are pleasant and attentive, location is good although not right on the beach, Jackie in the dining room is an asset to the hotel.  When booking Hilton properties I've come to expect a certain consistency of brand and attention to detail, especially at Double Trees.  This hotel was a disappointment.  Simple maintenance issues could so easily fix some of the cosmetic issues that were glaring in room 818.   The property is tired, but nothing that caulk, paint, and thorough elbow grease wouldn't fix.   Stretch the carpets. Replace chairs that are torn up around the edges.

Needed a couple rooms for local wedding, stayed here as I generally prefer Hilton properties. Nice location if you want walking to shops, higher ed stores, and about half mile if that to beach/strip. I was just staying to change for wedding on the beach, and overnight. What sets this apart is that all rooms are one bedroom suites, with doors closing the bedroom, very large room, with small kitchen. I generally get suites, not for kitchen but for the separate room, very roomy.  Entire venue was great, nice area outside with patio bar, seating etc, on the intracoastal, very busy part of city(as all surrounding area), but nice relaxing area outside to sit. Added bonus, while small, each room does open to a small balcony, again, much more room thatn\u2026", "date": "March 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d217354-r467766702", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Great Return Stay", "review": "Great experience - outstanding customer service, great views, perfect location.

Sadly the room was quite small even though there was a separate bedroom to the entry and kitchenette. Room prices at this hotel are at a premium at this time of the year apparently although I cannot understand why. We paid over $300.00 per day plus $28.00 per day for valet parking and frankly the cost is a rip-off although the season apparently dictates the cost of accommodation.

The showers leaked so bad it took a lot of towels to clean it up. Ethernet hotel had been booked to capacity and there was ALWAYS a towel shortage.

Beautiful views from the right rooms, comfortable beds, good service.  Cons: Expensive valet only parking but their service was friendly.  If your room is on the 6 lane road (3 each way) side of the hotel it can be noisy.

The room wasn't ready so we had to wait several hours. I think they called us around 2 PM to say the room was finally ready. The city view suite had a kitchen, which was not that nice I might add, and a separate living room off the bedroom. We didn't use the kitchen, so we didn't care it wasn't that nice. We did, however, like the oversized balcony and living room. It made having four people in the room much more enjoyable. We also liked the walk-in shower. The location wasn't bad either. The hotel is next to a mall with some nice restaurants, including Capital Grill, Truluck's, and Martini Blue. We ate at Truluck's and everything was great except the stone crabs, which were terrible.

Had a very enjoyable stay. The room was spacious and clean,  chocolate chip cookies were delicious. Staff was friendly and helpful. The only drawback would be if you have a room facing Sunrise Blvd. Traffic going over the bridge may keep you awake at night. Our room was facing the pool and noise was minimal.

Excellent check-in, nice clean 1 BR suite (a real suite with a separate BR), and outstanding service from all hotel staff. As noted in earlier reviews, the hotel location is excellent, with the mall and shopping center right across the street. Should mention Tommy D's for breakfast--nice deli/diner just a block away. FYI, the renovation is part of a conversion to a resort/timeshare combo; they will be allotting part of their rooms to owners. The new name will be GalleryOne Place by Doubletree.

I understand, however, what some are saying.  This is definately a family oriented hotel.  Although it's been years since I was last there, I had a wonderful stay.  My room was clean.  I had a suite on the 14th floor overlooking the Intracoastal/Ocean View.  However, during my stay there in 1999, a highrise Condo was being built, so now there is no ocean view at all.  My room faced the drawbridge/A1A.  I had room service twice.  Room service is expensive, but you come to expect that.  I found the food served from the restaurant to be very nice!  The only complaints that I have is that the rooms are a bit dated.  My bathroom, while large, needed renovation.  Thie tile looked dirty from\u2026", "date": "January 2004", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d217354-r2457083", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 4}, {"title": "I liked it", "review": "We stayed here because we were attending a wedding on the yacht outside the hotel.  I was pleasantly surprised with our stay.  We had a room on the 11th floor with a balcony.  We faced the intracostal waterway.  The room was spacious with a living room and a small kitchen.  Friends stayed on the 5th floor overlooking the patio and the intracostal waterway which was even nicer because it was a little quieter.  I had breakfast at the hotel restaurant which I thought was good.  The pool area is not hugh but it served the purpose.  There was an outdoor tiki hut for drinks though I thought the Daquiris had too much crushed ice.  Beach is a few blocks away but this location was ideal for this wedding.  I would stay here again.
