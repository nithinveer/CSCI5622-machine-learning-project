Yes, there is a lot of \"charm\" or \"character\" in that it is a small and windy combination of two prewar buildings, and the lobby is nicely decorated. But beyond that, there's nothing to write home about. Everything works just fine. As I said, the rooms and bathrooms are small, but on par with other NYC hotels. All the rooms I've stayed in have bathtubs and great shower pressure, so that's a plus. And they now have Japanese style HVAC systems that are very pleasant - not sure why the giant window AC units are still in the windows though.   What brings the score down here is in the details. The linens are on the rougher side of acceptable, and there are some (probably non-body fluid) stains. The towels are thin and scratchy.
