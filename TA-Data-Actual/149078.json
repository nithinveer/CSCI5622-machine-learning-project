The wardrobe drawers were unstable and top one fell down if pulled too far out. Our ice bucket had no knob on the lid so for 7 days we had to praise open with a plastic fork . The ice was not replenished daily, nor were the t bags. Service at the restaurants was very slow and poor. Four times our order was mixed up, food delivered that we hadn\u2019t ordered. But our main complaint was the price of the food. With a captive clientele, this place charges outrageously. $26US plus tax plus service charge for 2 prawn skewers that had two prawns each! Similar prices for all meals. We didn\u2019t even bother trying the fancy restaurant with those sorts of prices. Plain water should be free with every meal and teas and coffee should be fee at breakfast. The tapas lounge was so poorly serviced that we didn\u2019t go again. It took 30 mins for me to get my ordered drink. There were two other people there and three servers at the bar!  For a place charging around 500$ a night, this is not up to standard.

The water was amazing the staff was incredible and you even get a private Butler to help you with anything you need. It's like a concierge for 4 rooms only at any time of the day or night.

Even with this package, we still had a $1200 bill at the end of our stay. On top of that, every single time you order anything (could be a water bottle), they make you wait around while they write up a 0$ bill.

We have taken on board your feedback regarding a courtesy changing area. The management team will brainstorm further ideas to improve in this area.  Our Spa is offered as an option to our early arrival guests when it is not fully booked.

The only downside is that this resort is fairly costly and isolated so you have to secure all of your meals onsite, unless you rented a car or cab to take you elsewhere.  Prices are pretty steep for meals and a personal pet leave of mine is that they charge you for soft drink refills and even their house water.  With the prices for meals, this should not be an additional charge. Additionally, you pay a standard service charge of 10% and a value added tax of 10% more so when you tip beyond that, you are spending 25-30% towards your total bill.

Honestly, it's the best resort we've stayed at period. The main reason being the beach and pool. Not many resorts, including the extremely overrated (from what I hear) Jade Mountain, have a beach on premises. Sugar Beach does. It has it's own beach that people actually take day trips to, given how beautiful it is. We took a boat tour throughout the west coast of St. Lucia and didn't see one beach that even came close to how nice Sugar Beach's is. Even further, it's the only beach between the Pitons. The food, albeit pricey (which is expected at a 5 star resort), is very good. The drinks, again pricey but expected, were also great.

The resort was charging for beach chairs ($50 for each chair I believe), but we were fine using our beach towels. It was in August, which is out of season, so there was ample space for our party of 11.  Other than that, there was no charge to use the gorgeous white sand beach.   The snorkeling was among the best we experienced in St Lucia. The diving area is pretty narrow because of how deep the water gets just off the beach.

Unfortunately, your vacation with us coincided with half term in the UK and President\u2019s Day in the US, a time when we get more families at the resort. We do have times of the year when there are one a handful, if any, children on property and we always advise couples looking for a more adult only experience to book during these times (outside of major holidays and school vacations). Having said this, we do try to encourage families with young children to book the earliest possible dining times at all of our outlets, especially the Great Room. We also ensure the Cane Bar is an adult only space after 10pm. In addition, the jetty at the new Glenconner Beach is only open to guests 15 years and older in an effort to preserve some quiet beach space for guests who wish to have a more peaceful, relaxing, child-free experience.

I am happy to hear that on balance you had a fabulous vacation and that your expectations were exceeded in almost every area.  Thank you also for pointing out the areas  you feel we need to improve on.  Unfortunately, as you rightly point out, all beaches in St Lucia are public and we are continally fighting the battle with tour providers and the Soufriere Marine Management Area to control the influx of non-resident guests to the beach and the National Marine Reserve at the base of Petit Piton. This is a discussion we are continuing to have.For our part, we have set aside complimentary sun lounges and shade palapas at the northern end of the beach in a bid to encourage non-resident guests to utilise this area. This has been fairly successful in helping us maintain the exclusivity of the beach for our resident guests. It is also unfortunate that our second beach, Glenconner Beach, was closed at the time of your stay\u2014it is certainly far more private and not frequented by day visitors when open. Also, it would appear your honeymoon may have coincided with half term break in the UK which meant there would have been more children at the resort than at other times in the autumn months. We usually have just a handful of  guests in  September to mid-December. It is unfortunate that these issues took away from what should have been a trip of a lifetime and for that, I am truly sorry.

I am truly saddened to see this posted, considering the time we spent together discussing your experience before your departure. Not only are your accusations unjustified and an untrue reflection of the level of service that we offer at Sugar Beach, A Viceroy Resort; but they in no way illustrate the care and attention that was rendered to you in the run up to your wedding and during your time at the resort even when the unfortunate and upsetting family circumstances and last minute changes threatened to spoil your plans. Please allow me to remind you that you booked and paid for one room at the resort and this reservation was never changed or cancelled at any time. You were the only members of the wedding party staying at Sugar Beach and this was the case from the outset when you first started discussing your ceremony with our wedding planners. When you brought the reported situation concerning your cousin to our attention, we advised you to report the matter to the police so they could take appropriate action. I believe you and your cousin decided not to do so. As we agreed in our conversation, we at the resort cannot control all factors that take place off our property; and if your cousin was mugged while trying to purchase marijuana in the street, as he alleges, the police should have been informed as per your statement, the station was only half a block away. I do not appreciate when people try to create issues that do or did not exist and use this forum to perpetuate their false accusations especially when the issue involves someone that was a guest staying at another hotel. Sugar Beach, A Viceroy Resort has a reputation built on integrity and we take ownership of our business. When we slip up, we admit our lapses; we apologize for them and offer solutions.

It is a long windy drive which could make someone a little nauseous. The good news, the location is spectacular! Nestled between the Pitons, which are St. Lucia's 2 iconic dormant volcanic peaks, one could not ask for a more perfect setting for romance. It feels very similar to being in the South Pacific. The resort beach uses imported sand from Trinidad-Tobago, so it's perfectly white. We had an opportunity to take a boat to one of the Viceroy's competitors (which I won't name), and we looked around for about 5 minutes and jumped back on the boat to return.

It appears that you did not have a proper understanding of our resort and how things work before deciding to book with us. Regarding the all-inclusive meal plan, upon booking this package, it is thoroughly explained to allow guests the opportunity to make a decision based on what is not included.  I am sorry that you were not informed of the topography of the property and that you were not pleased with the idea of having to use a shuttle to take you from one point to the other. The shuttles generally pick up and drop guests in less than five minutes from the time the call is placed and has continuously proven to be very quick and efficient. The 10% service charge is mandatory government enforced fee that all hotels must charge, whereas leaving a tip or gratuity is discretionary and usually recommended as a reward for exemplary service that exceeded your expectations. The service charge is divided among all of the hotel line staff whereas gratuities are paid directly to the individual who delivered the service. Leaving a tip is not mandatory; we offer a genuine service to our guests. We have been, and continue to be, very transparent with our direct booking guests and with travel agents and tour operators about the continuing enhancement works at the resort.  We issue monthly updates informing them of all projects that are taking place at least six weeks in advance of the commencement of works. We rarely get guests sharing concerns about disturbance.

We take time to go through and understand every guest comment. It is important for us to understand where we went wrong and what we could have done better. Some of the points that we have highlighted are beyond our control as a resort.  Unfortunately, we cannot be accountable for things that happen outside the resort or on the beach\u2014all beaches are public in St Lucia.  On the other hand, we can fully control and correct the disappointments that you have highlighted in our immediate surroundings. All our beachfront bungalows were new-build structures two to three years ago, and not refurbished as you suggest. As part of general hotel maintenance, we constantly check all our accommodations and do touchups on them if necessary. We offer our guests 24 hour shuttle service from one point to the next on property. Our guests never have to walk anywhere on property, including the gym--although we have some people who choose to walk to the gym as part of their workout, it\u2019s a great warm-up.. I would like to apologize for the unhygienic and poor presentation of the coconut man, not to mention the revolting behavior you witnessed two years ago and described. We have explained to him that this behavior is unacceptable and this has now stopped. As an aside, we do explain to our guests that it is not mandatory to accept his offerings. A polite \u201cno thank you\u201d usually works to send him on his way. The boat operators that we contract to offer their services to our guests know of the very high standards that we expect from them. We insist their standards are always in line with those of the resort. The behavior that you have described was improper and would not be tolerated from any of our approved suppliers. However, because you chose a boat captain who was not approved by the resort, our hands are tied when thing like you describe happen. Like you said, it is best to let us make these kinds of arrangements on your behalf to avoid what you went through. I am sorry that the Cane Bar was not as full as you expected it to be. Some days, it\u2019s packed and on other days it\u2019s just as you described. I can guarantee you that all of our guests are very well informed about this venue. The numbers usually fluctuate according to who is staying with us. It\u2019s very popular when we have a large number of honeymooners in house. I would also like to apologize for the discomfort that you felt with the presence of the bugs and birds. This feedback is rare. We will start to monitor what you have described and take action if necessary. It\u2019s a shame that the island, and Sugar Beach, failed to live up to your expectations. Perhaps after a two-year gap, it might be worth revisiting as there have been numerous changes here at the resort which would ensure a more enjoyable stay.

It appears that you experienced a catalogue of disappointments and service inconsistencies especially in the area of food and beverage. I would like to apologize for less than satisfactory experiences that you have shared.  Although many of the things you have highlighted should not have happened in the first place, we would have greatly appreciated your feedback while you were still at the resort. I am confident that we would have been able to turn your experience around. We have been operating at very high occupancy and I am not certain why it was communicated to you that we were almost empty, this is very far from the truth. With that being said, we encourage our guests to put in a request for whatever preferences that they may have. We always communicate that there are no guarantees for ocean view rooms.  There are a number of contributing factors that impact the allocation of an ocean view room including stay patterns, room types booked and of course occupancy. I would like to apologize for the inconvenience caused. I am sure we would have allocated a room with a better view had one been available. We are very surprised to hear that you were ill during your stay. There are a number of other non-food related factors that could have caused this illness such as a virus or too much sun. We certainly have not had any other reports of guests feeling ill during the period you stayed. Again, we are sorry that you fell sick and hope that you are now fully recovered.   We are continuing to review our service standards in the areas that you have highlighted to ensure that all our guests are receiving a very high level of service and implementing additional training where required.  Again, I am sorry for the experiences that you have described. Your stay  appears to have fallen short of the usual high level of service that we offer.

We are pleased that you recognized and appreciated the positive enhancements that we have done at the resort over the last three years. I am sorry  to hear about  the overall experience that you have described.  At the time of booking your stay and buying the all inclusive meal plan, our reservations agents should have clearly explained the details of this package. I am sorry if there was a communication breakdown somewhere along the way. Very few items on the menu carry supplemental charges, however, items such as expensive cuts of steak, cold water lobster or other imported fish and seafood, and premium drinks do carry additional charges. The 10% service charge you noted on your checks is a mandatory government enforced fee that all hotels must charge.  Leaving a tip or gratuity, however, is discretionary and usually recommended as a reward for exemplary service that exceeded your expectations. The service charge collected  is divided among all of the hotel line staff, whereas gratuities are paid directly to the individual who delivered the service. Tipping is certainly not mandatory as our team members strive to deliver a genuine service to our guests without the expectation of receiving a tip. I understand your concern with signing the bill, even if you are on the All Inclusive meal plan.  The main reasons for having guests sign is because not all of our guests are on a meal plan, and there are items that may have been consumed that are not included in your package.  I am sorry that your choices of wine were not always available. We are continuously reviewing our wine offerings to ensure that we provide a balance list that accommodates every budget. There are no guarantees for late checkout. The only way to guarantee this service, especially when you are operating at high  occupancy, is to pay for an additional night (something that many of our guests flying to the UK opt to do) or to pay the late check fee to secure the room, again, subject to availability.

We would like to apologize for the disappointments that you have mentioned. I am surprised to hear of the condition of the taxi that collected you from the airport. Clearly it was not the SUV that you had requested and the condition you have described falls well short of the standard we expect from the taxi service we utilize. We do not allow damaged vehicles to transport our guest, and have taken great pains to educate the taxi association about appropriate standards of care.  We will certainly be taking this up with our suppliers and investigating what went wrong on this occasion. Regarding your request for a late checkout, I\u2019m afraid we are not always able to offer a late checkout. Our ability to do so depends on availability of rooms. It can only be guaranteed if guests pay for additional night/day use, so that you can keep the room as long as you wish before departure. If we have room available, we gladly accommodate requests.

Based on your review, you did not fully enjoy your time at Sugar Beach which is disappointing for both myself and my team members. I can understand your raised eyebrow when you were told at the time of booking a superior luxury villa was not available only to find it then became available at the time of your stay. When it comes to bookings, accommodation availability changes on a daily basis and sometimes changes multiple times on one day. I am happy that your preferred category became available at the time of your stay. We certainly would not deny our guests the room category of their choice if it is available at the time of booking. I am sorry that your first villa did not afford you the privacy you wanted, but delighted we were able to change that experience around.  I am also confused about the information you received concerning our occupancy levels at the time of your stay. We operate at very high occupancies year round\u2014definitely well in excess of the 60% quoted to you. I am sorry you received misleading information.  Your comments about our food and beverage offerings are also disappointing. Our culinary team puts a lot of effort into ensuring that every meal served is to the guest\u2019s satisfaction.

We had originally reserved a Sugar Mill Room because being close to the beach and the restaurants were our top priorities. However, upon arrival, we were taken immediately to Villa 703.

We are known for the world-class accommodation, facilities and top-flight service that we deliver to our guests. We are thankful that we had the opportunity to share this experience with you. I am sorry about the minor dissatisfaction that you highlighted. As we have highlighted in other recent reviews, in general, wine prices on the island tend to be higher than those enjoyed by our guests in their home countries. Government imposed import duties and shipping costs for wine add to their overall cost and thus the prices on our wine lists. Regarding service at the Terrace restaurant, we are continuing to review our service standards in that area to ensure that the service provided at breakfast matches the high service standards in our other outlets. Your advice about insect repellent is well received. The island\u2019s tropical climate means that we have the perfect habitat for these pests. Sugar Beach does have a comprehensive pest control program in place which involves fogging the entire property twice a week, and spraying guest accommodations every evening.  Sadly, some guests prove particularly attractive to these creatures and we always advise guests to carry repellant with them to prevent bites.  Thank you once again for your review.

I am delighted that we matched and surpassed your expectations in most areas. I am also glad that our team positively contributed to a great holiday experience and that they added special touches that you enjoyed. I am happy that you enjoyed our food and beverage offerings. Regarding more options for Creole food, had you made us aware of your feelings,  I am confident our executive chef would have  been more than happy to create these dishes for you. We are always getting rave reviews about the quality of our transportation system and the interaction of our friendly and professional shuttle drivers.  I am delighted that you share the same opinion. The spa and Cane Bare are truly amazing and word-class and I am pleased that you had the opportunity to experience it.   The resort will change name from the Jalousie Plantation to Sugar Beach, A Viceroy Resort on November 30, 2012. While other guests share your views about the loss of the Jalousie name, the reason for the change is to clearly signal the completion of the resort\u2019s multi-million dollar enhancement project. Sadly, the resort has enjoyed mixed success under the Jalousie name in the past and the resort ownership was anxious to indicate that after so much work, this is essentially a new resort. At the same time, all of us who work at Sugar Beach and live on the island will continue to keep the history alive and ensure Sugar Beach retains all of the very best elements of the Jalousie Plantation. The main pool is now redesigned and opened a few days ago. Unfortunately, the pool was closed for this remodeling project at the time of your stay.  I am glad that the upgrade that we gave you helped to some extent to compensate for the inconvenience caused. I am disappointed that the hot water issue in your villa was not rectified in a timely manner. We are continuing to review our service standards in that area to ensure that there is not a repeat of what you have described. I would also like to clarify your point about the all-inclusive package. Sugar Beach will continue to offer a range of meal plan options to guests from room only to all-inclusive. We have no intention of changing this very popular option for our guests. Once again, thank you for your business and feedback and we look forward to serving you again in the not too distant future.
