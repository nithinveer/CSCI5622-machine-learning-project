Small boutique hotel in a great location. The staff were so helpful and lovely and friendly. Our room was perfect. We had a different room the first night which wasn't so nice but it was because we arrived very late and were moved the next morning to a room next door. I am guessing that theres some renovation going on hence the first room being not as nice. Air conditioning was working fine so no problems there. Breakfast was gorgeous! Lovely fresh made omelettes every morning prepared by a great lady!..along with an array of fruits/pastries/juices/egg/toast and everything else. And the view was very special. Theres a terrace open to all at all hours and we had a few lovely nights up there watching the moon rise...just spectacular!

The Room was shabby, small and poorly furnished, The AC was not working, despite promises made by the staff no one came to rectify the AC. The Shower glass door was broken and all the water spilled into the washroom while i took a bath which made me slip. The Breakfast time was told as 7 to 10 AM but till 8 am no arrangements were made despite various reminders given to the staff. Room wasn't cleaned on both days. There is no Lift in the hotel so one has to climb all the floors by stairs for breakfast or going to the room. Will surely cause huge trouble for elderly people.

The room was beautiful and very comfortable. The personnel and the service were excellent. I received all the assistance I could wish for at all hours and by all categories of the personnel and always in a very friendly way. When returning after long days out of the hotel it was like coming home. The atmosphere in the hotel is warm and welcoming.  I want to thank all personnel for making my stay so enjoyable and congratulate the management for having created a hotel environment with the qualities mentioned above.", "date": "September 2007", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d729891-r10039673", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Check in / front desk": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5, "Business service (e.g., internet access)": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 5}]
