[{"title": "Amazing honeymoon, modern villas, ideal location", "review": "We recently stayed at Magic Village for 12 nights, on our honeymoon. We can't say enough good things about this resort.   The location is perfect. So close to Disney parks, really close to a huge new Walmart, and a Target/Publix in the other direction. Parking is free, and each villa has clearly marked reserved spaces. Easy location for Uber too (although if you do, make sure you message the driver to say pick up from the Black Lake Road entrance, as their GPS doesn't recognise the front entrance).   Our villa was spotlessly clean, and had all the amenities we need. The outside BBQ was amazing, our hot tub was so well maintained with someone checking it most days so it was always working perfectly, and inside was perfect. We loved the fridge freezer with ice dispensers, and the utility room was ideal. Our aircon was quiet and worked without any problems despite it being especially hot during our first week.   Lovely shampoo, conditioners, and body lotion are supplied in each room, and you get a set of mini-basics (washing up liquid, laundry detergent etc) to set you up for your first day.   We had an issue with our TV and the front desk team, and Laura in particular, were so quick to fix it. We had a technician come the same day and everything was fixed and working perfectly.   We didn't use the pool in the main building but we did sit by it on our last day and it is a lovely space with lots of comfy seating around the edge.   We will definitely return if we come back to Orlando, and would highly recommend Magic Village to friends and family.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d7303068-r727916966", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "OK", "review": "Room cleanness needs attention as well as maintenance, the front desk service was great! location is excellent.

The first condo had a bad odor, had not been properly cleaned, carpet badly stained, broken toilet and clogged shower drain. Complained to management and was moved to a different condo. The manager was very helpful. He moved our luggage and even left snacks for the children. Later that night I noticed a few ants in the bedroom. The next day, went back to office to inform them of the ant problem to see if they would come spray. They said had to call pest control and they'd be there that day. Pest control never showed up. I returned that night to find that the ant situation had gotten much worse! Could not sleep in bedroom! Pest control came the following day and the manager sent house keeping to clean first floor and change bed. There is a gate at the entrance, but gate was left open for 3 days straight. Although I was inconvenienced many times during my stay dealing with issues, I have to admit that the staff was awesome! Everyone was always helpful and extremely nice. It's clear that the property is not being maintained at a satisfactory level!!

What they lack on the outdoors they more than make up for indoors.  The unit was spotless.  There was nothing lacking.  I had the downstairs bedroom and my family members had the 3 bedrooms upstairs.
