Old world charm with very modern amenities, a comfortable bed, a bathroom which was very modern and spotless and even a pressing machine for people who need to iron while on the road.  The breakfasts were excellent and tried to accomodate all guests and their cultural tastes.   We found the staff to be attentive and very pleasant.  The only 'glitch' was that the hair dryer did not work.  We notified the desk and a brand new unit was installed while we were out.  Problem solved by the cheerful and attentive staff.

We had a very small shower that the floor looked like it had never been cleaned, and when showering the first morning the shower did not drain.

We asked for a room with a balcony and were given a very pleasant room at the rear which overlooked the hotel's courtyard areas and surrounding rooftops and roof gardens.  The standard of cleanliness was very high - with clean, crisp white sheets provided every day!  The breakfast buffet was good, with a hot choice each day and served by friendly staff.  The hotel was well located within a stone's throw of the S M Novella train station and within 5 - 10 minutes walk of the main centre, the river and a whole host of restaurants and bars in the main piazza's etc.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Rivoli and would\u2026", "date": "April 2006", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d202976-r4973016", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Booked a room - maybe not !!", "review": "I am always a little hesitant about booking hotels in Europe because the photos on the websites are often ...well...not as the actual hotel appears.

My booking was confirmed and I was told \"Don't worry about your late arrival we will hold the room for you\" You can imagine how annoyed I was when we turned up to be told there \"were many room problems\" and told that we would have to go and stay at another hotel in their chain.  This seemed to happen to another guest in a previous review for this hotel.
