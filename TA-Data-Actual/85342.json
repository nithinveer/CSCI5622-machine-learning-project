My special request for a high floor room was met. I even love the Hilton application which shows you your room number one day before u even check in.

However, our area does tend to be very much alive a little later on the weekends.  While our International Drive rooms are the most requested by repeat guests, they are not for everyone.  With that said, there is an opportunity to improve the soundproofing of the sliding doors within the guest suites.  In fact, we have a project scheduled for later this year to enhance the sliding doors and soundproof the suites to limit outside noise from local establishments on International Drive and the highway behind the hotel.  We are actually very fortunate to have very thick walls, which lead to a lower number of in-house noise complaints from other guests or the atrium.

In lieu of simply applying a better seal to the sliding doors on the guest suites, we are looking into replacing them completely with a sound proof solution similar to what you would find at many airport hotels.

Furthermore, the curtains on the rear typically close very well and I need to check those out.  It sounds as if someone removed the sheer and a full panel and failed to replace them.  The front curtains have been a source of concern from our guests.  We have magnets at the Front Desk that we hand out upon request but we have also been moving the tracks closer together to help ensure the windows are covered completely so nobody can see in.

We obviously have some retraining to do with the person that handled your arrival.  We recently had a challenge with the hot water taking up to 5 minutes to reach a certain corner of the building and we have had a master plumber working with our Chief Engineer to discover the issue and replace some key components to the system.

I stay in hotels quite frequently for work.  Here for business frr 4 nights.  Hotel needs updating pretty bad.  Very dated.  Second day I was there, room was still not serviced at 5pm, even though I'd be out of the room since 8am.  Extremely disappointed as I wanted to sit in my room and catch up on work.  They gave me a voucher to the restaurant while they cleaned the room, and I hate to say I went back in a time warp in the restaurant.  No atmosphere and extremely dated as well.

What this hotel has going for it is its location on I Drive: it's in easy walking distance to lots of restaurants, Walgreens, the Orlando visitor centre and the iRide trolley. It couldn't be more convenient.  The hotel itself is pretty dated and could probably do with a refurb, but it's very clean and the rooms are big. It's handy having a fridge and coffee maker, but I thought it a bit mean to just provide paper cups in the room: some proper cups would be appreciated. The beds are very big and comfortable. And the toiletries are very nice, and also include hair conditioner.   There are safety deposit boxes available at reception - no in-room safes. I find this quite tedious; having to wait at reception for access to a safety box most days.

Three of the four lead to exterior guest areas and our guests are welcome to utilize them when going down.  They are never locked from the inside.  However, they are kept locked from the outside for safety and security reasons so if someone wishes to go upstairs via the stairs, a team member would need to assist.

They also need to cook the omelets separately due to food allergies and the simple fact of not wanting other customer's meat (ham, bacon) in your vegetarian omelet.

I am a Hilton Honors member and stay in Hilton hotels regularly.  I booked this hotel using points and am extremely disappointed in the cleanliness of the room.  This hotel needs to be updated significantly and should not be compared to other Embassy Suites.  The room we stayed in, on the 6th floor, had crumbs on the floor, and the trim in the bathroom had quite alot of water damage.  The pull out sofa bed had alot of cigarette burns in the sheets and blankets on it (this was a non-smoking room) and the mattress was so thin that you could feel the coils and it was very uncomfortable for the kids.  The tv remote did not have batteries that worked, so we requested more.

The all inclusive breakfast is a brilliant idea, the staff are very friendly they would bend over backwards to help you.  Had lunch and dinner there a couple of times the menu had a lot to choose from.  Centrally located.  The only downsides to our stay were not enough safety deposit boxes to go around we didn't get a box till 7 days into our stay,  the hotel bar wasn't the best any type of drink we asked for they were out of so we drank in TGI Fridays bar which was just accross the road any type of drink you wanted they had.

Well lets begin at when me, my husband, my sister and her 3 children arrived at the reception desk. I gave my name Karen Sonners but they said that they had nothing down on computer. I told them we had booked over 8 months ago but she wouldn't listen, saying we had no reservation at the hotel. She said that she would have to see the manager and we had to wait. We had to wait around 10 minutes for her to come back and tell us we were in fact on their records! At this point I was sick of waiting around and wanted to get to my \"suite\". After all that torture they put us through, they then put us on the FOURTH floor! I was disgusted. The least they could do was give us a room on the bottom floor after all the messing about they had caused us.
