[{"title": "avoid!!!!", "review": "i have stayed in many hotels in turkey over the past 20 years and i have to say this is by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in, im pretty sure i would have had a better holiday if i had stayed with the homeless guy who sleeps in the abandoned car at the back of the hotel.   I travelled as a single traveller knowing full well that this part of Turkey caters mainly for germans and russians, this does not bother me in the slightest , but i have never encountered a more rude and disrespectful staff as i did here.  i arrived in the early hours and after travelling for 12 hours i asked for a glass of wine, i was told the bar was shut but i could have a glass for a price, the guy on reception wanted 50 tl which is not a great amount but you know full well its going in his back pocket.  the rooms were clean enough but the veiw of the shopping centre below from the balcony was hardly appealing.  The food ..now where do i start ..how about absolutely disgusting....on 2 occasions the food left my body quicker than it entered it , to the point i ended up just eating bread and salad,  one night i lifted the lid up to be confronted by fish heads ..yup just heads with their little eyes just looking at me.  chips worse than maccies,  reheated pasta night after night....the snack at 4 consisted of stuff that hadnt been eaten at lunch.   At breakfast i had to get my tea from a machine in reception, take it into the dining room and use the milk they had near the cereals, on my last day i asked for cold milk at about 4 in the afternoon to be told we dont have cold milk only hot (out of the machine)  i asked if i could possibly get some cold milk and was told no..my response was ..you dont like the english very much do you?   the restaurant managers answer was NO!!!  To sum up ..i can honestly say this was the worst holiday i have ever been on, the staff are rude, the food is inedible, location is ok i suppose, the beach is a rip off as you cannot even take a bottle of water with you, basically dont bother ....pontins is better than this place!!!!\u2026", "date": "May 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d2658248-r691333039", "sub_review": {"Location": 2, "Cleanliness": 3, "Service": 1}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled solo", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Not a 4 star hotel", "review": "This is in no way a 4 star hotel. The gym is less than inviting, with old floors and broken mirrors, the pool is small and the food is okay but no way 4 star. There was an ice cream freezer but it was empty when we asked we were told we could get ice cream next week - shame we were not going to be around for it as we only stayed 1 week. The staff are strict but I cannot fault them on that really. Perhaps they can use a softer approach but they are very sharp and immediately chastise people for bad behavior such as drinking too much or making too much noise. In one way this is good and reasurring but in another way it comes accross quite harsh, we saw 2 people being removed from the public bar or restaurant to be told off in the managers office. Both times the guest was drunk. All inclusive here means the bar closes at 11pm and before it closes they also ration the alcohol. so dont think you can for example order 2 drinks before closing, noooo - you can have a new drink once your current drink is finished, and then sometimes the bar closes at 22:55 or the vodka is finished. on our first night we arrived at 22.45 and were taken up to our room, by the time we came back the bar was closed, we could only drink water or fruit juice.  They also ripped us off arranging tickets for a night club and transfer to Side - they charged us 10 euro saying it was for mini bus plus disco entry and a free drink - not bad we thought till you find out a taxi is only 8 euro, the disco entry was free and the drink was a weak cocktail in a shot glass. Total rip off as there were 7 of us who paid 10 euro each when we could have shared taxis at 8 euro per 4 persons.  Also you can get a shuttle to the beach but once their you are hit heavily to buy food and drink, if you dont you can still sit there but you are told exactly where to sit and you cannot take your own food or drink with you. Busses to the beach leave in morning at 9 or 10 and come back at 4 or 5. also when we arrived we were told to pay 50 to 70 euro for a room with a balcony, when we refused we got the room with balcony anyway - im not even sure there are any rooms without a balcony.   Enough said? we had a good holiday loved the place and the people but the hotel, it was okay but now way 4 start.\u2026", "date": "June 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d2658248-r679069963", "sub_review": {"Location": 4, "Rooms": 3, "Service": 2}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "\"Ok\"?", "review": "+Good hotel location- old town, the beach, Novo +hotel shuttle to the beach or 25 min walk by the shore +COPPA beach is wider and better than 5* +rooms are good condition and clean.

This hotel does not cater for the English (no English flag out side hotel is your first give away) It is German /Russian hotel and the staff fall over themselves to accommodate them, German food , no English breakfast if you took children there is nothing for them to eat , food is below average. I feel totally ripped off as we stayed all inclusive and eat out for breakfast and dinner, as we could not eat what they was serving up. (We did try but apart from it being very poor it was also a health hazard as covered in flys ) The all inclusive drinks are a total pee take basically, one draft beer which never heard of...no efes beer...in a Turkish hotel !?. Vodka was rationed few afternoons staff would tell you no vodka and do the same in the evening, probably to make sure enough for the Russian and would keep offering you whiskey or raki as no one else wanted it, soft drinks and mixers was always flat. Towels was changed twice in a week and second change was only cause I asked for clean ones.

So, for anyone still here, let me ask you please to keep reading as this is a genuine review from someone who's stayed in turkey on holiday at least 10 years now so I know the standard of a 3* hotel in Turkey and let me tell you, this hotel isn't even a 2*.  We stayed as a family of 4. 2 adults and two kids ages 14 and 17. Never have I been to a hotel in which I wanted to leave as soon as I got there. I don't know how we managed 2 weeks there.  Only good thing was the beds in the room which were quite comfy.   The rest was awful. Firstly, the hotel is very small and we felt trapped for the whole holiday like prisoners.

Their air con is also out of this world and you absolutely need this because its BOILING over there right now.  A few things to point out which made the holiday   The pool area was amazing, the warmest pool I've ever used and the slide was a lot of fun.  NB The slide opens around 10am and closes for 2 hours at lunch time and is then on again until 6pm.

We went as a couple and we are 21 and 23 years old, we do ALOT of travelling and stay anywhere between 2* - 5* hotels so have a lot to compare it with.   Pros: - For a smaller and not very popular hotel, the room was probably one of the better quality I have stayed in. I would compare the room to a 4/5* room. Cleaned daily, give you ample toilet rolls/towels etc. Good size balcony, great free air conditioning, lots of wardrobe and storage space. If you are staying at this hotel just as a base to sleep it will be perfect because the rooms are great.  - Not bad sized pool with a slide  - Bar serves enough of a variety of local spirits (vodka / whisky / wine / beer etc)\u2026", "date": "July 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d2658248-r599890618", "sub_review": {"Value": 3, "Cleanliness": 3, "Service": 2}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Perfect week", "review": "Just returned from a week at Holiday City Hotel.
