[{"title": "Welcome to 70s", "review": "View is fantastic - indisputable. But, this is probably everything positive I can say about this place. The hotel is so old that I felt myself as being in 70s or 80s (I was not even born on that time) because of this, I was feeling I was paying a lot of money for very cheap old lodging. it does not cost 150-200 per night, even with a view cockroaches in the room (again - \"hello from 70s/80s\") wifi was working terrible (as if it was not working) breakfasts were ok (nothing special, and definitely not for money they charge) restaurant - food was good but quite expensive.  and the hotel tries to make money on everything (probably trying to persuade you not to come again): I was shocked when I was informed that I have to pay for having an iron and an iron desk. In 4-star hotel? I travelled a lot in different european cities. and even in very cheap hostels you could get an iron (or go to a special place). here - nothing like this obviously, there was no tea pot in the room (saving money on clients - moto of this hotel)  I do not recommend this hotel. it does not cost. very poor conditions. even in a very basic 3-star hotels one will get more comfort and facilities (and new modern facilities) for 2-3 times less\u2026", "date": "July 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664156-d1095334-r627843306", "sub_review": {"Location": 5, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 3}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 2}, {"title": "First taste of the Lakes", "review": "Much better than expected from some of the reviews. Must have recently been updated or at least in our room 'large superior Lake view room' 106. The views were to die for, breathtaking. Patio needed attention grass not cut or attention to trailing  plants could have made such a difference. Hotel staff made it, very polite and friendly and always a smile on their face despite the long hours. Building itself we found very clinical no colour, no pictures to brighten the place up and the downside no cosy lounge area other than open area next to diners or other room that looked like a conference room. Meals- breakfast could not fault there was nothing that anyone would want for even fresh veg/fruit juicers. Evening meals,salad bar again excellent and set menu gave three choices for each course which unfortunately we found a little bland. Swimming pool area lovely nice size and very clean. Sauna/steam room could only be used if you were naked im no prude but would at lease liked a choice in the matter. Overall good holiday lots to do around the area and see. Moved on to Lake Maggiore which currently outshines Lake Garda especially Stresa.\u2026", "date": "September 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664156-d1095334-r521891854", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Only area that grants it 4 stars is the view...", "review": "It's a great hotel if you're staying there for the fitness activities (pool, sauna, tennis courts and it seems like they do fitness classes too - not sure if this would be in German though since most of the guests were...). We appreciated the view from our balcony, day and night the views were amazing.  But the room itself was extremely basic. We didn't have a kettle, coffee facilities or air con but there was a small fridge and bathroom toiletries. The hotel itself would benefit from an update - the furniture is tired and looks like the place is stuck in the 90s.  If you're not good with heights (or driving vertically), this hotel probably isnt right for you - the roads are not for the faint hearted but worth the view when you get up there. Parking also looks limited at first glance but there is more around the back of the tennis courts. The breakfast had plenty of options but... the cakes/pastries were uncovered - much to the pleasure of the flies, the water for boiling eggs was vile smelling and not fresh. The bread for toast was stale and the fruit juices tasted cheap,  like pure sugar. Not the best breakfast experience I've ever had. There are cute, hidden restaurants down the road, La Baita offers 10% off your bill if you're staying at the hotel. The staff are great and the food is even better. It's within walking distance so embrace the local wines on offer! There is ample choice of hotels around Lake Garda and there are certainly better ones.\u2026", "date": "August 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664156-d1095334-r512361215", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Tennis fun", "review": "A nice hotel if you want easy going tennis days.

It is a little bit more expensive, but is worth it.

Breathtaking  -the lake, the mountains, the towns and villages like exotic jewels along the lake shore... The hotel staff were wonderful. We visited at the end of the season but they were as cheery and helpful as if it was the start.

This hotel seems geared up for walkers and hikers. The residents were mainly German.   The road leading to the hotel requires nerves of steel and makes the hotel difficult to travel from. It takes about 25 minutes to get from the main road around the lake to the hotel which is right on the top of one of the mountains; this adds quite a bit if travel time, I would definitely avoid this hotel when icy as the roads must be impassible.
