We had a standard room with side lake view (you can upgrade to a room on the front of the hotel, however you are only 2 minutes away from the sundeck which has the same view) The room was spacious & clean with a good bathroom. The breakfast each morning was great, with a good selection & the added bonus of looking out over the lake while you eat. The location of the Hotel puts you right in the middle of all the action, 5 minutes from the ferry dock and bus station. There are plenty of restaurants & bars all within strolling distance (including the Hotels own restaurant) The staff were all very helpful & friendly. The sundeck was fantastic, you can take a dip in the lake, sunbathe or just check out the sunset. Great Hotel.

Our room was very obviously recently refurbished----modern furnishings are not my favourite style, but it was nicely and thoughtfully done.  The room was very large by European standards; we had plenty of room even for our massive amount of luggage.  The spacious bathroom also was brand-new and very stylish, and included a jacuzzi bathtub.  There was no coffee/tea service in the room, but breakfast in the nice room overlooking the lake is included in the price.

Some of the reviews made me cautious in booking but the hotel is very nice.  The ride in from the Desenzano Rai Station was disheartening as the south part of Lake Garda is overbuilt.  But our spirits lifted as we progressed up the narrow peninsula and got to the minimal auto zone over the moat bridge where we found ourselves in a living monument.  The hotel rooms are done in what I'd call that clean, swiss style.  Nice recent tilework in the bathroom and parquet floors in the room.  Our rooms, 37 and 38, overlooked the lake with a beautiful western view.  One also sees the adjacent ferry.  Decks over the water on the lakeside of the hotel allow sunning and snoozing.

The hotel is bright and spacious and immaculately clean, much attention being paid to keep it that way daily.  Be sure to get a room with a full front view of Lake Garda with a balcony, rooms 37 and 38.  Other superior rooms look out onto the ally, or air conditioning units.  Some have partial lake views, others none at all even though they are superior.

The room was quite small but adequate; the most annoying thing about it was the location of the wardrobe which was so close to the TV and fridge that you couldn't actually open the wardrobe door properly!
