It was cozy, bright and clean with a modern touch. Bathroom was very nice and clean too fully tiled with a bathtub hence easy to give kids a bath.   Housekeeping was good, with bedlinen and towels changed everyday along with general cleaning. Turkish breakfast on the terrace with a nice view of the sea but dont expect western breakfasts as there were no cereals either but lucky for me i had already taken cereal boxes for my kids. The ladies serving the breakfast were very sweet and lovely! A big thankyou to them!

The room is ok for its rate and the shower is good; the breakfast is also good with a remarkable view from the terrace. However, the service of the front desk staff (daytime shift) is just bad if not terrible - he is arrogant and not helpful and provided limited information upon enquiries; the worst part of my stay was that he questioned my wife rudely and for why didnt we book the airport shuttle via him when the shuttle bus came to pick  us up at the hotel (the price quoted by him was higher than the one we eventually booked for). All in all, if you don't care about service and just want a room to spend a night at reasonable cost, this hotel might be a choice for you.

Room: it was very small, the bed mostly occupied the room. it was so small that a chair could not even fit in the room. Otherwise it was clean, airconditioned, the bathroom was very nice and we had plenty of fresh towels.  Breakfast: It was very nice too, not your typical english (assuming you're there to try the local cuisine). everything looked fresh. On the downside, there was not much of variety.   One thing that disturbed me was that they did not have an iron to lent me, which i find it odd.  Location: a lot of people say that the location of the hotel is its strongest point but i disagree.
