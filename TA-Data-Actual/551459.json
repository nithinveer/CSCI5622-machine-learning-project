You also forgot to tell us that you were travelling with a child and made a reservation for two adults only. At any rate, we were more than happy to provide an extra bed for your son at no cost.  - Our reception manager was really sorry to hear about your discomfort, so she offered a free upgrade to a bigger room, but you refused. We honestly did our best to accommodate your situation but even in our Suites, we don't have king or queen size mattresses. Our matrimonial beds are made pushing together two twin size beds. It was simply not possible for us to fully satisfy your request, and for that, we owe you an apology.  - It's really unfortunate that you didn't receive enough assistance. We strive to provide excellent customer service and, in fact, our clerks were glad to help you with your luggage. If you visit us again, please, feel free to tell us about your every need.
