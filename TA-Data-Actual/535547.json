[{"title": "City break with sunshine", "review": "We have recently returned from a lovely seven day break at the Hotel Maestranza. We can highly recommend staying at this city centre hotel- it\u2019s position is brilliant and the facilities there are excellent. We had a really well positioned room on the 10th floor and loved our balcony view, overlooking the sea, the port and the city. The staff were friendly and helpful and made our stay a very pleasant one. There was a good range of food provided for breakfast although the hot food could have been kept warmer. The rooftop terrace was a highlight- it gives a beautiful view over the city and is a lovely place to relax after a busy day.

I think they\u2019d put modern dimension fittings in an older space.  The room was at the back on the fourth floor, so it had a lovely hillside view, was quiet, but got no afternoon sun. The big mystery was, why were there no chairs or table on the balcony? It was a pity, as we could not sit outside and enjoy the view. Good air conditioning, to cool the room down. I see from other comment that some rooms had coffee making facilities, our room did not. don\u2019t know why. Breakfast was a reasonable standard and the food was very fresh.

The modern hotels, often belonging to hotel chains, tend to have standardized all important aspects of your hotel stay. As such, everything is pretty good: the beds, the decor, the sheets, the bathroom, etc. The classic hotels - and I'm specifically referring to the older hotels - may have risen to 4 stars years ago, and may have done some aspects of the room really good, but other aspects less so, or some things may have become outdated.  MS Maestranza in M\u00e0laga feels like it belongs to the 2nd category. If we focus purely on the rooms, I would rate it as a 3 star hotel.

The hotel is situated in a convenient location and has all of Malaga\u2019s amenities on the doorstep. We were on 6 th floor looking at The Alcazaba and the Bull Ring. I think this is important that people know this. I am highly offended by bull rings and what goes on there. I was horrified to wake up to the full sight of it. It is not in use thankfully and looks like it\u2019s under long term repair. Either way I feel I should inform others because if a fight was going on when I stayed there I\u2019d have moved hotels.

We were so pleased with the quality and location of the hotel we came back with friends to spend a night in Malaga. Didn't have hotel breakfast but lovely cafe on ground floor, which has home made bread etc. My friend advises that the croissants are the best she has tasted. Car park available nearby. The hotel valet park your car. Cost e15 per day. You park your car at the rear of the hotel, by the bull ring & check in & they will park your car. Voucher for glass of fizz on arrival.
