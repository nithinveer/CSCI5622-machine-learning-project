The room itself was spacious and the bed was really comfy.

There was a smell of stale smoke in the bedroom when we arrived.When we reported this to reception staff they brought  a dehumidifier and set it up and this seemed to help the situation when it was switched on.

However I believe if you had explored Balbriggan more, you would have found an array of unique and interesting places and activities.  One of Balbriggan\u2019s most recognisable tourist attractions is our beautiful harbour and lighthouse.   Balbriggan is proud of its coastal heritage and a walk along our shoreline offers, not only enviable coastal beauty, but also a rich maritime history.   Balbriggan still retains an active fishing fleet and our working harbour is a 1 minute short walk from the Hotel.   A visit to the harbour provides many photo opportunities of the lighthouse and the harbour itself. The harbour, built in 1761 is home to numerous fishing vessels. At the end of the harbour is the lighthouse with two commerative plaques in memory of Patrick Hanley who drowned near this spot in 1957 and Baron (George) Hamilton who was the driving force behind the building of the harbour.  The Railway Viaduct and the Lifeboat House are the town\u2019s most famous landmarks.  The Viaduct was completed in 1844 as part of the Dublin to Drogheda line and was officially opened in March the same year. The viaduct is an ideal place for viewing the harbour and on a clear day the Mountains of Mourne are clearly visible.  Situated snugly under an arch of the viaduct, the Lifeboat House had been used to smoke fish before becoming a storehouse for local industry.  Built of rubble stone with dressed limestone surrounds to the openings. It is said that the upper part of the building was intended to provide sleeping quarters for the cox swain who gave up using it because of the noise overhead. It has a fine slate root with a dormer window set into the apex at the front. The original plaques with the date and initials of the station are placed on either side of the main entrance.  The Front Strand is Balbriggan\u2019s main beach. It\u2019s a natural inlet and is ideal for building sand castles, bathing and soaking up the sun. During the summer months a lifeguard is on duty when the appropriate flag is flying. A pleasant walk further up the coast takes you to the Martello tower built in the 1800\u2032s to ward off any invasions by Napoleon. Just below the Martello Tower are the ruins of the Boathouses.  Balbriggan beach is an ideal walking spot.  Rich with history and natural vistas, and with beaches just waiting for sandcastles to be built, there is something here for everyone in the family.  Just outside of town and visible from the coast road is Ardgillan Castle. A lovely location to visit, Ardgillan Castle has miles of park areas, award winning gardens and a charming coffee shop. It also has a play park for the kids and a Holistic Center. Ardgillan is a truly beautiful spot with incredible views of the ocean and is not to be missed!  Ardgillan Castle and Demesne is situated on an elevated coastline between Balbriggan and Skerries. The park consists of 194 acres of rolling open grassland, mixed woodland and gardens, overlooking the Irish Sea with views of Mourne Mountains to the north and Lambay to the south-east. Ardgillan is a sanctuary for many species of animals, mammals and birds for which the wooded areas provide a safe retreat from surrounding agricultural land.  The gardens are in three main parts, the formal Rose Garden, which gives a lovely display during the summer, the Potentilla collection to the West of the castle, and the walled garden to the North West which contains herb, vegetable, fruit, and ornamental sections.  The Victorian Conservatory was originally built in 1880 at Seamount, Malahide, and the home of the Jameson family, who became famous for their whiskey all over the world. It was built by a Scottish glasshouse builder McKenzie & Moncur Engineering, and is reputed to be a replica of a glasshouse built at Balmoral in Scotland, the Scottish home of the British Royal Family. The conservatory was donated to Fingal County Council by the present owner of Seamount, the Treacy family and was re-located to the Ardgillan Rose Garden in the mid-1990s by park staff.  Ardgillan has a playground with over 30 pieces of play equipment to enjoy from cradle swings for the very young to a large climbing space net for older children (under 12).  The park also has a tea room and a holistic centre, so a visit to Ardgillan is a great day out for the entire family. The main car park is located close to the demesne entrance at \u201cBlackhills\u201d, while a second car and coach park, adjacent to the castle is open for castle visitors from Monday to Saturday.  If you are into activities you have come to the right place. A visit to Balbriggan Golf Club offers a healthy day out.  The Golf Club is among the premier parkland courses in Leinster and visitors are always welcome. We have a state-of-the-art Xtreme Sports Adventure Centre five minutes outside of town, which offers outdoor activities for all ages. In the same area, you can try a day of clay pidgeon shooting, fishing or tennis.  The Dublin Falconry facility at Courtlough is a place for young and old alike to enjoy a fabulous day close to nature and our feathered friends. This year, Dublin falconry will be home to thirty Owls, Falcons and Hawks by the end of the breeding season.  The Falconry is run by Trevor Roach who has been involved in Falconry since he was Eight years old and he has flown many species of Hawks, Falcons and Owls. Dublin Falconry is a centre of excellence for the art of Falconry and it always delivers a thrilling and educational visit. Set in the countryside in beautiful surroundings the birds are outstanding. Trevor has an infectious enthusiasm for his craft and it is obviously far more than a day job to him. The show itself is educational and very interesting; everyone gets a chance to interact with the birds, to hold them and to take part in the displays.  Courtlough Fishery is Ireland\u2019s newest Rainbow Trout fishery, working off 4 acres of spring fed lakes in a naturally rural setting and only 5 minutes drive from Balbriggan. They offer fly fishing for fully finned superb quality rainbow trout from 1lb to 15 lb on their 3.5 acre main lake, or bait fishing on their smaller \u2018junior\u2019 pond.  Their water is gin clear and provides the added thrill of seeing the fish follow and attack your fly. Their main lake runs to a depth of 20 feet, with an abundance of natural fly and invertebrate life to keep their trout in prime fighting condition. They aim to offer an unbeatable angling experience to all of their visitors, whether they are advanced anglers or absolute novices, with their resident instructor onsite helping to get everyone enjoying the fantastic sport of trout fishing.  For beginners, you need not worry about buying any fishing tackle as they can provide all equipment (rods, reels, safety equipment etc.) that you may require for your day.  Balrothery village in Balbriggan, with it\u2019s gorgeous old church and pretty cottages is a lovely location, and is simply bursting with history and stories from the past! St. Peter\u2019s Church in Balrothery, now deconsecrated and restored as a heritage centre, offers fantastic photo opportunities with it\u2019s gothic arched windows and diamond pattern caments and gothic arched door.  Balrothery is located about 1 km south of the Bracken Court Hotel.  The Balrothery Inn, which was originally a coach house, has since 1656 tended to the needs of the weary traveller, making their way from Dublin to Drogheda. It is a is a traditional family owned pub with so much to offer with its great history, strong local presence and great food, located in the heart of the quaint village. The Balrothery Inn is extremely family friendly and children are most welcome.  From the Balrothery Inn, a short drive up the road will take you to the famous Man O War Pub.  This cottage style pub is a picture to behold, with its thatched roof, whitewashed walls and superb old style comfortable bar, lounge & restaurant.   If you\u2019re looking to escape to a world of tranquillity and well-being, then balbriggan has only the best.  Monica Tolan\u2019s Beauty Salon located directly across from the Bracken Court Hotel, is an award winning salon catering to many celebrity clients in Ireland as well as their local clientele. They are a favourite of many celebrities such as Little Mix. They won Salon of the Year in 2012/2013/2014 and continue to wow with the latest in beauty treatments. Monica Tolan\u2019s offers everything from cosmetic treatments to advance skincare treatments such as Dermalogica Facials and Botox, and they are masters of HD brows!  A visit to the balbriggan tourist office located right beside the Bracken Court Hotel is the ideal place to get all the information necessary to start exploring our rich and diverse heritage. The girls there are only too happy to assist and chat about the many unique offerings in Balbriggan.  After all this the Hotel bar is the ideal spot to rest you\u2019re worn out feet with a pint of the finest Guinness, Balbriggan has to offer.

We are glad that you found the hotel to be clean and thank you for your comment regarding the furnishings in the rooms.  We are sorry that it was so busy when you checked in and out.  We had a number of weddings over the course of the weekend and were fully booked.  While we try to be as prepared as possible, it can sometimes seem a little hectic to our guests.  We are aware of this and are trying to ensure a smoother check-in by increasing the staffing levels at busy times.  There is no night club within the hotel but if your room was above the main door then this might account for the noise you heard.  We are sorry if this inconvenienced you and are disappointed you did not get a good nights sleep.  Breakfast usually starts at 7.30am and we will certainly investigate why the hot food was not ready when you arrived for breakfast.  We are very disappointed by your comments as this is not the norm within the hotel and we take great pride in both the quality and presentation of the food we serve.  If you would like to discuss this further, please feel free to contact me directly and I would be delighted to respond.  My direct email is nicola@moriartygroup.ie.

With both Breakfast & evening meals cooked fresh in front of guests, the food was world class & better than some of the Michelin Five Star restaraunts we have dined at, including service from the staff. From Steak to Fish dishes, sweets that are luxurious, a particular favourite was the hotels 'pork belly ribs' cooked in a unique marinade.

We had wandered around town looking at menus in other establishments and soon realised things were not going to be cheap - We opted to eat a bar-snack at the hotel in the evening - this was actually quite good value and the food was fabulous.

There were two double doors opening into a fantastic suite with fireplace, dressing room, huge bathroom, sitting area, minibar and coffee etc. A four poster bed dominated the room , the furniture was very chic and overall I was gobsmacked that I hadn't heard of such a great hotel before.

To be honest, we all must be talking about a different hotel because our experience was wonderful.  First up, the hotel is in Balbriggan - so do your homework about the location before you book it.  The hotel itself is really nice, exactly like the photos on trip advisor.  Bedroom was spacious and bright ,and the bathroom immaculate.  Our only complaint was that we couldn't connect to the free wi-fi for some reason (but that wasn't the hotels fault.)  A free car park is right under the hotel, so its fairly secure.

The rest of the town is truly awful. the official tourist guide can only find a tiny stone bridge in the town and the medical centre to comment on, so draw your own conclusions.
