The beach is not so close to the hotel - they made up for it with golf cart service - and the sand isn't as clean as the beaches to the north.  But it was quieter here than the hotels to the north, so that was nice. Maybe we will be back someday?  We shall see.

A few things to be aware of however, I picked this largely because it is a Sheraton and I have Platinum status and figured it was very close to Clearwater beach. It is a little too far to walk over the bridge into Clearwater but there is a free Trolley / Tram every 30mins the Jolly Trolley - free if you show your room card - we used this a lot and it comes right into the Sheraton Property.  The beach was a huge disappointment - given it is a mile down the coast I expected it to be more of the same compared to Clearwater - it isn\u2019t - the Sand is quite compacted and not attractive at all, with quite a lot of small shells. The sea was not attractive at Clearwater either on the days we were there - maybe just churned up with the weather. I love relaxing on the beach but this beach doesn\u2019t have any wow factor. It is nice and long for a walk though and plenty of people were collecting shells.  The beach is a 5 minute walk from the hotel pool - not a big deal at all for anyone able bodied - however, they have a golf buddy and will run you up there is if you wish.  The pool area is nice albeit small - strangely no umbrellas at all other than on tables so shade would be difficult to come by when the hotel is busy - this wasn\u2019t a problem for us. The pool staff were great - esp the Aussie guy, super happy and chatting all the time. Loads of games and floats etc were available to use free of charge.  The hotel itself is very much long overdue a renovation - it looks very outdated - however it is clean and this didn\u2019t bother us. We used SPG suite nights to get upgraded to a huge suite - which was very badly laid out but had plenty of space with a King and a large sofa bed for the kids.  As platinum we had access to the Executive lounge - this was great 6pm-8pm daily a few snacks and drinks beers, wines, spirits was a great stop off on the way back to the room before heading out for dinner. The ladies looking after us in there were excellent. The lounge is open morning to night for coffees and soft drinks too. As platinum we could have a continental breakfast in the lounge or use the Platinum benefit to upgrade the 2 Adults to full breakfast buffet in Rusty's - we did this and it was nice - not a wonderful buffet but had plenty of choice. Bacon, Sausage, potatoes, alternate days French toast and Pancakes, plus fruits yogurts, pastries and breads.  It was Halloween while we were there and the staff made a big effort and had a Pumpkin contest which was nice touch.  The only big complaint is that as you walked from the hotel through the conference area to the Trolley stop absolutely stank of mould - it was disgusting and it was there the whole trip - Management really need to sort that out and there didn't even seem to be an attempt to mask it with air freshener.  Recommend the \u201cLittle Toot\u201d Dolphin trip in Clearwater- reasonable cost too.  Overall we had a nice time, but next time I would likely choose to stay in Clearwater Beach. I would come back but only if I got a good deal on rate or after they renovate. I could imagine some people giving a bad review, but we knew it was in need of renovation so apart from the smell in the conference center the other issues (beach, loaction) were beyond the hotels control.  Edit - just to add I almost forgot - the cost of the sunbeds in front of teh hotel and also on Clearwater beach is so expensive it defies belief - as said the beach isnt great anyway but the cost of 4 beds and an parasol was around $60!!!! I was being scammed (obviously didnt pay) either as similar cost on Clearwater beach and a big sign up for around $40 for 2 beds and a parasol.  There were about 3 couples on the beach beds at any time I walked down there - I wonder why! I dont think these were hotel controlled as far as I could make out - but good to be ware.     Definitely a contender for the most expenseive beds in the world\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d84217-r725751493", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Location": 3, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Well situated hotel on the beach", "review": "Our room was clean in most respects, except we it wasn\u2019t vacuumed.

I am pleased that you enjoyed your interaction with our associates as they are the people who live our brands every day and devote their energy to bringing them to life for our guests. They also are caring, efficient and genuinely friendly and thank you for recognizing them.  I do apologize for your disappointment concerning the beach, there are several reasons that during your recent visit was not the beach you remembered. The beach in front of the Sheraton Sand Key Resort is a nesting beach, a place where Sea Turtles have chosen to nest. Sea turtles they are now given legal protection in the United States and its waters under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We are unable to take heavy equipment out to rake our beach unless we are given permission, which is actually a daily call from the Clearwater Aquarium during the months of May till October. Raking the shells and seaweed as well as bright lights can actually disturb nesting females and hatchlings and cause them to abort, there are large penalties and fines if the many guide lines are not followed. Also the associate who mentioned the break wall is also correct. Due to the break-wall to the North of Sand Key Park there are times that waves or current action deposits crushed shells and reworks the sediments. I am sure you also noted that the beach is also much larger that too is due to the break wall, they are built to protect and to reduce beach erosion. Much sand has been added by Mother Nature and the break wall to our beach Hopefully this gives you a better understanding of why our beach is left the condition Mother Nature desires it to be that day.  The hotel does provide complimentary loungers and hammocks in the sand, around the pool and many of the grassy areas around the Gulf side of the resort. Most area resorts include charges for the cabanas along the shore in a nightly resort fee. We have opted not to include a resort or parking fee. That is a private concession for the cabanas and they charge $35 per day for the usage should the guest so choose to use. Still on your walk down memory lane we hope you enjoyed this tropical paradise; with breathtaking sunsets and awesome views. The smell of salt water, the gentle roar of the waves all combine to create a sense of peace and calm here on the beaches of Sand Key. We look forward to when your travels next bring you back to the Clearwater Beach area.

If you are seeking a healthy dose of happiness, you can find it on the 13 acres of private beach in the front of the Sheraton Sand Key Resort and Vitamin D might just be the magic pill. The best part; sunshine is free along with the beauty that surrounds us! This tropical paradises can immerse you in relaxation therapy and you are able to balance that with many of beach side amenities offered such as tennis, beach tennis, pickle-ball, volley ball and so much more. Sand Key Park being adjunct to our beach adds even more to do, you can find a mixture of nature, wildlife, walking trails and a large playground even a fishing place just a few minutes away.  Being on this Island Oasis surrounded by all the beauty that Mother Nature has shared with us with and a great work environment does inspire positive attitudes among associates such as Todd. He truly takes joy from being warm, welcoming and knowledgeable which enables him to ensure your stay is the experience you anticipated, he thanks you for recognizing him The hotel does provide complimentary loungers and hammocks in the sand, around the pool and many of the grassy areas around the resort along with a complementary shuttle to get you to the shore and we can not forget free trolley rides that will take you anywhere on these Barrier Islands. Concerning the cabanas, many area resorts include those charges for the cabanas along the shore in a nightly resort fee, which means rain or shine you have paid for those cabanas. We have opted not to include a resort fee or parking fee and there is no charge for many of our amenities such as the use of beach games mentioned. Those cabanas are a private concession, they charge $35 per day for the usage should the guest so choose to use. We agree a view would enhance the dining experience, the Sheraton Sand Key Resort has been on this beautiful and tranquil island for many years and was designed in the style of the era in which it was built. We are constantly renovating throughout the resort including all the Food and Beverage outlets we realize there is always more to be done. We are unable to change the location of our extremely large kitchen which is why the restaurants are located in the middle of the hotel.

We do understand the distance can be an inconvenience which is the reason we have added a 6 person beach complementary shuttle to get you back and forth to the beach whenever needed. We have also added beach wagons which will conveniently help you get your children or what is needed down to the shore to enjoy your day at the beach. This time of the year we also have the Beach Buggy which delivers food and beverage right to the water\u2019s edge and we now have a server taking and delivering orders right to your lounge chair or table around the pool.

Truly many of our guest never drive as the Sheraton Sand Key Resort hotel guests can ride all Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) transportation free of charge (up to 4 people with one room key). These buses and trolleys will pick you up front of the Sheraton Sand Key and will take you to the mall or to any beach attractions anywhere in the area. You can get on and off whenever the mood strikes as the bus stops every 1-10th of a mile. Ask one of the Bellman and they will show you how to track pick up times on your phone and there are schedules at each stop. There is also the Jolly Trolley in which will take you where you would like to go in the Clearwater beach area and do not forget Uber or a taxi. Taking one of the transportation options offered saves the stress of driving and finding your way around (the drivers are very helpful) it save the cost of parking although we offer free parking for our guests, to park anywhere in the Clearwater Beach or surrounding areas can be costly.

There are many, many months when we truly are that peaceful paradise.  Being right on the beach and being a casual beach resort also makes us a great place for families with children although they normally only vacation here when school is out, we enjoy seeing that joy and memories being made.

Providing the highest level of hospitality is our number one priority and we sincerely apologize for falling short of meeting your expectations. This time of the year can be a very difficult time for us to honor late check-outs as we are sold out most nights and it is virtually impossible for us to meet the upgrade requests of all guests including our loyal SPG members.  We are a casual beach resort and have been on the beautiful and tranquil Island of Sand Key for many years.  Still, we take much pride in the appearance of the hotel and we are constantly making improvements. We also have many plans for future renovations, especially concerning the bathrooms.   Yes a beach get-away is truly all about the beach and the relaxation therapy you receive by being near the water. This is truly is a tropical paradise and I am pleased you enjoyed some beautiful mornings on the beach and I know you caught several breathtaking sunsets. Our 13 acres of beach front is considered private; however starting July 1, 2018, the law restricts local governments from adopting ordinances regarding customary use which establishes public access to private beaches, despite owners who may want to keep their beach front exclusive. In Florida, the \"wet sand\" area below the mean high water line toward the sea is public. The \"dry sand\" area above that belongs to the property owner. You are correct and as much as we try to ensure that only our guests are using our beach amenities it is hard to police the many acers of beach in front of the Sheraton Sand Key. We do check the immediate surroundings often such as the pool, beach games along with the shuttle and as you said the parking lot is manned by security, although it is truly not a gratuity based job. We are always looking for better solutions to keep our amenities available only to our valued hotel guests.  Concerning the cost for cabanas, many area resorts charge a resort fee that may include cabana charges whether used or not.  The Sheraton Sand Key does not charge a resort fee or a parking fee to our guests. Our cabanas are run by a private vendor that makes them available to our guests for a charge of $25 per day. We do hope your travels bring you back to the Clearwater Beach area as there is much more fun to be had and areas to explore.

True the beach is a bit of a walk and I can empathize with you completely as it is a 4-5 minute walk through the sand, Clearwater and Sand Key are known for their exceptionally large beaches. When the hotel was built the beach was much closer to the hotel actually right up to the break wall. Then the Sand Key jetty was built in 1975, since then sand has been washed in a southerly direction which has caused a wide beach.  We do understand the distance can be an inconvenience which is the reason we have added a 6 person beach complementary shuttle to get you back and forth to the beach whenever needed. You are correct about the traffic although it is not the traffic on Sand Key it is trying to get through the busy Clearwater area as there is much activity there.

As you stated we do not have the nightly resort fees that most area hotels charge when staying with us you are correct there is free parking and concerning the amenities you only pay for what is used such as cabanas and fitness center etc. We are very proud of our associates and pleased you always enjoy the positive interaction with our associates as they are the people who live our brands every day and devote their energy to bringing them to life for our guests.  They are truly caring, efficient and genuinely friendly and I am sure due to the longevity of many of our associates you have gotten to know them by name.

You are correct we are one the very few hotels on the beach which does not charge a resort fee, parking is free and you only pay for amenities used.

A private beach where you can spend uninterrupted time with your own thoughts and birdsong mingling with the ocean breeze, it is true therapy at its best.  We truly thank you for your comments on our associates, they are pleased to provide you with an effortless experience and make you feel truly at home by being genuinely friendly, caring and efficient. Your comment on the associates at the poolside caf\u00e9 has been addressed, they were not conscious of looking like they did not enjoy their interaction with our guests. Without making excuses it is very hot this time of the year, being outside all day does wear on them. We look forward to a return visit and your comments are truly appreciated.

There truly is no excuse for the condition your room was in and is certainly not the impression we at the Sheraton Sand Key or the Sheraton brand wanted you to experience. This along with the condition of the carpets has been addressed with the Director of Housekeeping and please let me assure you a solution is being discussed today! Concerning the beach chairs along the shore, many area resorts include those charges in a nightly resort fee. We have opted not to include a resort fee. There is a private concession for the chairs and umbrella they charge $25 per day for usage should the guest so choose to use. There are loungers in the sand, several with umbrellas which are free of charge. Our food prices are in line with all area hotel and you are correct the area does offer some less expensive options. Yes, our beach is private and beautiful and there are many treasured memories to be made here on the Island of Sand Key which I do hope will bring you back for your next beach get-away.", "date": "July 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d84217-r502200172", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Extremely disappointing -avoid", "review": "I called last minute to book a sister weekend for my sister's birthday.

The water was warm and clean and even I went in the pool twice which is a rare moment.

The \"problem,\" if it really was one, was the imperfect view of the Intracoastal and the searing morning sun preventing pleasant use of the balcony. (is there a way to make rooftops more pleasant looking? I'm positive there is). So, I called the front desk and found we were lucky and rebooked after the second night to a room on the gulf side.

There are loungers and \u201cyour sweet spot\u201d hammocks in the sand which are free of charge. There are Wave Runners, Kayaks and power sports available also by private concessions on our beach. We do not set prices, we do ensure they are in line with other concessions in the area. Along with beach tennis, Coach Rhino provides an array of activities for guests of all ages. Such as beach tennis clinics, sand volleyball games, corn hole and other outside activities. It is always fun to see our guests busy and smiling. Next we have considered putting in a Starbucks Kiosk, there are many reason why it has not been done.

We're always working on new ways to better care for you. Once you get on the Island of Sand Key you leave all that commercial stuff that clutters life behind; it reminds us of the beauty of nature that surrounds us. The sounds are so peaceful and serene how can you do anything but relax, that is when not busy with your conference. Our beach is truly large and it keeps us away from the shore, which also keeps us safer from storms. It is around a five minute walk and you can defiantly always find your own private beach space. Being away from the hotel gives you a true Island experience. We are constantly updating throughout the hotel and housekeeping is very efficient at keeping the hotel clean and comfortable, I thank you for recognizing Anna.

The Sun Coast Dixie Jazz Festival which has been with us for the past 26 years is always the week before Thanksgiving and is very popular. Like any musical event there are times it can be a bit loud. It is group of people of different ages although the majority of them are over 60. They enjoy the music of word famous musicians and are personally not disruptive. Concerning the noise due to the repairs on the Poolside Caf\u00e9. The repairs were unavoidable due to the damage caused by hurricane Hermine. It was a bit of wait with permits and contractors which made us unsure when that would happen. We did our best to control the noise as much as possible. Still that is no excuse for you having to endure all of that disrupting noise. When we realized both events were happing at once we did try to compensate by offering the use of the cabanas at no charge to take our guests away from the noise. Being on the shore line you are totally away from any of those noises we are trying to escapee from. We also had permission to offer our guests the use of the Marriott pool which is a 5 minute walk. Being away from the activity of Clearwater Beach is actually a positive for many of our guests. They enjoy being in-between both worlds. We are at most times a truly very tranquil Island.

Storms can pack a powerful punch, with soaking rain, when this happens we usually pump 24 hours a day. Prior to Hurricane Hermine we were informed that no pumping or vehicles would be allowed on the beach by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Agency. Due to the storm winds, tidal surge and extensive rainfall, there was a need for all beach activities to halt until the shoreline could be inspected for turtle nests and subsequent assessment of loss or damage.

We are very aware that the weather has taken its toll on our beach and we know that it has played a part in the disappointment of our guests.  Our area has received a tremendous amount of rainfall and the beach just will not absorb more at this point. We do attempt to clear the water by utilizing pumps, however, this environmentally approved process tends to be slow.   We have found over the past several years that our business has changed and we are experiencing more vacationers than convention attendees.  We realize this does mean more guests at the pool area and have been exploring solutions to this change in our business.  We are very excited about these solutions as we know it will enhance the guest experience considerably.  It is feedback such as yours that leads us to these improvements so we thank you for sharing your thoughts.  Again, I am terribly sorry that your impression of our resort was not as you had expected nor what we had intended.  On behalf of our entire team, we apologize for not reaching your expectations.

Or you might be in the middle of the Sand Key Bridge looking at the beautiful view of boats and small islands below. Two things determine the size of sand on beaches: the energy (height) of the waves, and the size of the material furnished to the beach. Other things being equal, the higher the average waves on a beach, the coarser the sand. This is because higher waves tend to move the smaller grains of fshore to quieter water. Dune sand is consistently finer grained than the adjacent beaches even though the dune sand is derived from winds blowing across the beach. The difference in size is due to the fact that winds generally only pick up and carry the finer grains of beach sand and leave the heavier, larger sand grains behind. It is rewarding to read that your experience was what was anticipated mostly. We look forward to your next visit.

Two things determine the size of sand on beaches: the energy (height) of the waves, and the size of the material furnished to the beach. Other things being equal, the higher the average waves on a beach, the coarser the sand. We do have a beach buggy which serves refreshments right on the beach.

It felt healthy just walking on the beach and not being approached by beach vendors.  Sunsets were amazing.  Food was awesome.  You must try the calamari at Rusty's Bistro.

I found the facilities very basic (pool, eating options, room and bathroom) and looking back on the experience the high points from my time in clear water had nothing to do with the hotel - it was more to do with the area (the beach is amazing, as is the sea/sunsets etc)  The stay was very average and I didnt feel that anyone went out of\u2026", "date": "June 2012", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d84217-r134892399", "sub_review": {"Value": 2, "Location": 3, "Sleep Quality": 3, "Rooms": 3, "Cleanliness": 3, "Service": 3}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Customer Service A+", "review": "Just returned from a week long stay at this beautiful resort.

They have two bins for plasics and paper for recycling.   We delighted when we discovered the special touches - we were given a bottle of champagne & strawberries on Ice.
