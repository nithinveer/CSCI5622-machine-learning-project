We truly appreciate all feedback we receive so we can continually improve our hotel!

Las Olas Boulevard is South Florida\u2019s most architecturally unique, authentic, and eclectic shopping and dining district.  In addition to all the restaurant options there are 2 world class museums, 10 major international art galleries and 65 different shops along the Boulevard.   Our in-room safes are provided so you may secure your valuables and require key card access.  They are not designed to be accessed using your credit card but rather your room key.    Our elevators do require room key access for extra security which we have found to be an added benefit to our guests.  You will not find many hotels in the Fort Lauderdale/Miami area that don't have this feature.   Our parking garage is connected to the hotel as you mentioned and is secure as room key access is required.  We apologize if you found the garage to be a bit tight.  We have many spots on the first floor that we use for larger vehicles.  There is also an additional lot across from us that may be used if additional parking is needed for larger vehicles.
