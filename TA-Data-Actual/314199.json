The hotel itself was clean and tidy, breakfast was very nice and the staff were very helpful and polite.  We did find that due to the hotel being close to the main road and our room facing onto the road that it was very noisy, due to the amount of traffic that passes in and out of Riva.

The balcony was also small  with enough room for one chair basically but the pleasant views of the garden and the mountains in the distance more than made up for this. There is so much to do and see in the area that it is unlikely you would spend much time there anyway. Something worth pointing out is that there is no lift in this hotel and it would not suit someone with impaired mobility as all rooms are situated upstairs.

Situated with the majority of hotels about 20 minutes walk from the centre of Riva. Great value, really clean and the staff were very friendly. Nice pool and garden at the back of the hotel which is very quiet and relaxing. Only a couple of hundred metres from the Lake, where a path takes you to Riva alongside the lake and through lovely gardens. Riva itself is a fantastic town, large enough to contain a variery of excellent restaurants and shops - with a bit of culture thrown in. We had a room at the side of the hotel - if we stayed again, we would ask for a room at the back overlooking the garden - much quieter although the noise from the road wasn't too bad.

The hotel caters well for the single traveller, having single rooms at no supplement.  The rooms are adequate in size and comfortable.  The hotel itself is very clean and the food is a good standard, breakfast being pretty much the same each morning with a choice of cold meats and cheese, yoghurts, toast, bread rolls and plenty of jams, honey, etc to choose from.  I stayed on a Half Board basis and found the evening meals to be very good.  There are three choices for starter, main course and pudding - something for everyone I think.

We had a twin and our son had a single, both nice and clean and pleasant. Both rooms overlooked the neat garden with clean swimming pool, which was a bit cold as not heated.
