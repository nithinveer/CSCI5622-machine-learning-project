The rooms were big, airy and comfortable. The yoga studio is so peaceful and well equipped. We were served delicious healthy meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner using always the freshest of local ingredients and herbs and fruits from the Hotel's own garden. There are always tea/coffee making facilities available at every floor of the hotel. Plenty of nature walks nearby which is wonderful during breaks from yoga.   My husband and I felt so comfortable and peaceful that we hardly ventured out of the hotel.  When we were not doing yoga, we were either chilling out at the pool, reading in the library or pampering ourselves with the various therapeutic treatments available.\u2026", "date": "November 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g660261-d1550390-r437358959", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Peaceful, serene and beautiful destination for a Yoga Retreat", "review": "What more could you ask of a holiday than a to spend it with interesting and interested people, be well fed, enjoy fine accommodation in an idyllic environment, with the added privilege of an audience with the incredible Simon Low?

I can only comment that I have been to Santillan twice in 4 months and would again at the drop of a hat if money and time were not constraints. I could find no fault - the staff were incredibly friendly, the setting beautiful, the yoga shala awe-inspiring, the rooms characterful and clean, the food delicious, varied and plentiful, and my fellow guests like-minded and incredibly positive.  To describe my recent trip as a real tonic for both the mind and body would be a gross underestimate - I have returned to \"reality\" revitalised, energised and thoroughly refreshed, with many happy memories.
