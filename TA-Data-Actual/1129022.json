For its selling points, let's cover the basics. The hotel should in every right be commended for its steal of a location, with the bulk of Istanbul's heritage sitting, very literally a hop, a skip, and short jump away, with the likes of Hagia Sophia and Sultanahmet Camii (Blue Mosque). What's more, is it's, easy to reach, the main road where The Grand Bazaar and Bosphorus pier would be only a 30-minute walk radius where one would only have to follow the map that is helpfully personalised and provided by the hotel (at no extra cost) down that main road or loudly marked metro-stop accordingly. With most start Bus tours easily within 5-minute walking distance as to mark the value of the hotel's location alone worth it. Secondly, the value paid for, I personally would say is worth to the penny. My girlfriend and I found, as university students, with much relief that a place like this could exist for our 4-night stay, what ultimately was paid for was a place we could safely and comfortably stay the night, that is what was exactly provided and arguably more. The view from breakfast does not disappoint, with a beautiful overlook of the Bosphorus toward Istanbul's eastern limb. Further the consistent breakfast that is daily provided for just an extra \u00a32  every day would provide the essentials of a local Turkish breakfast for the morning. In the long run, meaning not every day necessarily has to be chanced on a restaurant breakfast that could be up to 29TL (\u00a34 as of current exchange rate) per person. The hotel staff alone are knowledgeable, obliging, and actively looking to make sure all is well with the stay. The small acts of having your name memorised, the daily ever hospitable restaurant staff at the base of the hotel or happily explaining ongoing events (As my girlfriend and I were unaware we had arrived during the 'Bayram' festive period) helped build the experience that built The 'Eski Konak Otel' as such a major pillar to build our experience Istanbul as the cultural labyrinth it deserves to be experienced as. Can't help but recommend for like-minded travellers that love being instantaneously where lies Istanbul's, cultural heart. \"Either I conquer Istanbul or Istanbul conquers me.\" \u2013 Mehmed the Conqueror\u2026", "date": "August 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1129022-r608916143", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Great place to stay", "review": "Highly disappointed.
