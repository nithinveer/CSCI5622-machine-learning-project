[{"title": "The best choice to spoil your vacation", "review": "We have stayed at this hotel from 07/23/19 till 07/30/19. Even though Smile park is a 3 star hotel, I could not even imagine how low  its personnel competence would be and to what extent service offered there is poor. I would like to share with you a couple of examples. Perhaps my experience will prevent you from making a mistake and urge you to find a better place to stay on vacation. For the whole period of my stay there (which is 7 days) DAILY cleaning came only twice (no pun intended). Such a great honour was granted to us on the first and last days of our stay (after previous residents' departure and before next residents' arrival - what a sweet way to reduce your staff energy consumption). The most unpleasant thing about it is that when I got tired of living in a 'trash bin' I came to  reception desk and informed that I had waited for cleaning  on previous days but noone came and I would stay in the room and wait for cleaning today to have it for sure. The receptionist said no problem. I have been waiting in the room for more than 4 hours and it was already 5 PM (cleaning hours were till 4 PM everyday) and when I returned to the desk and kindly asked what the matter was, the receptionist (a different one this time - very tall man, whose name I unfortunatelly don't remember) ignored my questions and started to talk with his coworker in turkish giving me glimpses and laughing. When I tried to repeat my request he continued to ignore me for some time and finally said that room cleaning would be tomorrow (on the day of our departure). To make you feel my pain I would like to picture  you how bad our room condition was at the time: sand and long hair all over the floor, trash falling over small bins - partially lying on the floor too. So I decided to take the cleaning into my own hands, emtied the bins content into one of my bags and put it out of the door next to the reception desk (our room located very close to the latter). Later in the day, right by the beggining of the dinner, someone knocked at the door and  asked if we need cleaning. We let the man in and he went to the bathroom directly. The worker was absent for more than 20 minutes and I decided it's strange since last time it had taken the staff 5 minutes to clean the bathroom and proceed further. So I decided to check. When I came to the bathroom I saw nobody - the man just exited through another door. The floor was still dirty. The hotel's workers flagrant incompetence shocked me many times. I could continue describing other incidents but I think it would be excessive. To conclude, Smile park hotel *3 does not suit anyone who is used to respectfull attitude and at least modest service.\u2026", "date": "July 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d8473177-r696856992", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Avoid if British, fussy eaters, sun lovers don't tolerate bad manners and rudeness", "review": "We arrived on 10th June to be told that the only other English couple here were eagerly awaiting our arrival.  Our room was no 610, over the Bar, it was clean and spacious, but basic - glad I brought our travel kettle (coffee, tea, sugar & milk available next door at the supermarket - smile, please & thank you - show the other nationalities up for their rudeness???)  there was a fridge in the room, but not particularly cold.  All I can say is that we had a friendly welcome and all the staff were friendly when we smiled, pleased and thank you'd.  But this is not an all inclusive location from our personal experience - there are strict timings for meals and drinks and the Eastern Europeans were like ants, lining up ready to pounce on their prey!!!  Under the advice of the other Brit couple we were advised to try The Melissa Gardens, & other than one day/night when we treated ourselves to The Crystal Sunrise Queen Resort, this is where we spent most of our time, paying for food & drinks.  The drinks were tasteless in alcohol unless you ask for large vodka & little sprite, the one evening meal we experienced was worse than a McDonalds takeaway - soup had run out, plenty of salad, wait for hot food to be replinished (no sweets - these are only served at 4pm) was told no hot breakfast choices.  Also the pool area lost the majority of it's sunshine by 2pm.  Take your own towels.  Hairdryer in bathroom.  We won't be back.\u2026", "date": "June 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d8473177-r493988941", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Rainbow Castle Hotel Side", "review": "Had a wonderful holiday at this hotel the first 2 weeks in June, we were sent there because the hotel we had previously booked, went bust, I am pleased it did, we had a wonderful holiday at this hotel, the food was varied and plentyful, still heard others complain about it, but if you want English food, holiday in England. It was all inclusive, and the range of drinks was limited, but there was an unlimited flow of Beer, Vodka, Raki and wines. visitors should respect that this is predominantly a Muslim Country, and we should respect that. We arrived at midnight, the man on reception was most helpful, I explained that I needed a ground floor apartment, he carried our luggage to a wonderful 2 bedroom apartment with 2 balconies and a large bathroom.absolutely fabulous, The staff were very pleasant and helpful, Why do people complain about this hotel, ask them what they paid, I paid \u00a3600 for 2 people all inclusive at this hotel for 2 weeks, including flights and transfers, a bargain , if you want 5 star hotels, pay 5 star prices. will highly recommend this hotel, We had a wonderful experience.\u2026", "date": "June 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d8473177-r427380576", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Rooms": 4, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Don't go", "review": "Arrived late on night 11.20.pm was offered no refreshment and had to go shop next door.

The setting was nice close to shops and to the beach. Food was always fresh with a wide variety of dishes being well presented and with lots of fresh fruit on offer. Rooms were enough comfortable,  well appointed with a very good bathroom, shower and a reasonably comfortable bed, and what is important, always clean. Brilliant first trip to Turkey.

Not far from the beach. But on the nearest beach you have to pay for chaise lounge.. on the other beach there is a servis bus (3 times in a morning and afternoon). Beaches are very good )) So.. about hotel.. It's small 4 flats houses coloured in rainbow colours... looking nice. But inside  not so good furniture especial in bathrooms :(( our bathroom didn't close... and the entrance door was broken before us..  no elevators Meager meal.. its good but small selection. In the bar there are \"Marmara\" beer (so so), wine, gin, vodka and rak\u0131.  Personel are not professional. .. of course for this money they can't be. So...
