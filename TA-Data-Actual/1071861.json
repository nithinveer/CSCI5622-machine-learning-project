[{"title": "A Gem of a hotel", "review": "We visited as a group of 38 which included breakfast and an evening meal. We also had tea in the afternoon and wine/beer/soft drinks included in the package. We stayed in room 209 from which the picture is taken. The entire area is amazingly clean and tidy. The hotel has an indoor and outdoor pool along with a gym and spa facilities should you want to book a treatment.  We dreaded the food having read the reviews of previous tourists that had the buffet style menu. We had no complaints at all with the food. Was all hot and tasty and very plentiful.  Some amazing walks in the vicinity and a few bars and restaurants within a 5-20 walk. I highly recommend this place. The staff couldn\u2019t do enough for us. The bar and food if purchased were very reasonably priced especially for the area. We went to a nearby restaurant on the first lunch and thought we were paying for an expensive slice of pizza each,turned out it was a very cheap full and very tasty pizza.... Silly tourists.

We had a room on the ground floor facing the swimming pool.  The swimming pool is oblong and very large - no doubt necessary when the hotel is at full capacity and during hot weather - the siting of the pool is functional though rather unimaginative.  The room and linen were fine, -- clean and entirely acceptable without being spectacular.The staff were friendly and helpful and the prices for \"extras\" (e.g. drinks) were reasonable.  The location of the hotel is very convenient for the village of Manerba (with a few cafes and restaurants) but is well above the lake (though no lake views), so a lake-side visit will require at least a 20 minute steepish downhill walk with the ensuing, and rather more challenging\u2026", "date": "June 2013", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664151-d1071861-r164986335", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Location": 3, "Sleep Quality": 4, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "TRIP OF A LIFETIME", "review": "0ur daughter recently got married in Lake Garda, and we stayed at this Hotel. Spotlessly clean rooms, great atmosphere and the pool area was brill. All the wedding guests stayed here also and found it to be great value for money and were very happy with the service overall. The most important part for us, was the excellent staff in this Hotel. They were simply superb, and nothing was too much trouble. Special thanks to Luisa, Lenka, Andrea, Antonio, Guiseppe, Catalin, and Simone, who made everything so easy for us. Thinking already of another trip as soon as we can. Our daughter and her new husband were really happy with this Hotel and have said they too want to pay a return visit.

With regard to the hotel, found the accomodation basic , a little on the cold side( not temperature) and the beds the weakest point in my view rather uncomfortable and short. Also the cost of wifi is simply ridiculous!!!  On the plus side the pool area is lovely, the staff fantastic, the bar pleasant, the evenings quiet and relaxed and the local area fantastic. Breakfast was fine the food good but as always in Italy  take your coffee in the bar in these places. So much better.   Porto dusano is a real hidden gem. We strolled down, swan, ate, and drank in fading sunset over the lake. Swimming in the lake was wonderful in early June, water temps pleasant and all around the views majestic.  In addition the local village had three restaurants which\u2026", "date": "June 2012", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664151-d1071861-r157241363", "sub_review": {"Value": 3, "Location": 4, "Rooms": 2, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Okay :)", "review": "I stayed here with my school back last year there were over 100 students, the hotel handled us very well, the rooms were clean, the bath room was clean, the shower could of done with updating, the pool was freezing i got pushed in... was so cold, was my only time in it, the food was well em okay, the teachers got what they wanted we got what were given, the breakfast was lovely it was buffet, the morning we were leaving they set it all up for us even though we were leaving for the airport at 4.30AM,TIP: bring some food away with you if ur going out for the day, or a long jorney, they didn't mind us taking stuff ), in the room there was a bunk bed with the top bunk with no ladder or bar incase you fell off, and there was 2 beds in the middle of the ground, there was a big\u2026", "date": "April 2011", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664151-d1071861-r125236689", "sub_review": {"Value": 3, "Location": 5, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 4}]
