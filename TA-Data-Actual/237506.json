The saving grace of the place was good brewed coffee. However, I had to wait for 45mins on one day and was almost late for my tour.   Overall, less than pleasant attitude by the staff. I constantly made to feel like I was causing an inconvience whenever I had to ask for milk for my coffee or asked the receptionist to about where to explore or confirmed my booked tours for me.   Upon check out, I was told that they only accepted cash for tourist tax even though they had facilities for credit cards. It would have been nice if I was informed about that anytime in my 3 days stay there. And I was charged an extra 1 euro for paying with credit card which is not standard practice.

Having previously enjoyed trips both Rome and Venice, we were really looking forward to a nice stay in Florence.  The hotel is conveniently located very close to the train station in Florence, within an easy walking distance.  It is easy to find.  The entrance was typical for hotels in Florence and elsewhere in Italy.  We checked in just at sundown, and were shown to the room.  When we entered the room, it was musty smelling and dirty.  The furniture and bedspread were covered by dust, the carpet was in need of a good vacuuming.  The bathroom was partially clean, but the tub/shower was infested with mildew.

Air conditioning in the rooms excellent. Comfy beds as well. Rooms were a good size, we had two which faced  away from the street so it was very quiet, hard to believe we were in the centre of Florence. Hot showers variable, sometimes hot and sometimes not. Room 116 has a nasty damp patch on the bathroom ceiling and you do need to fix this please managment as it smells bad. Staff always courteous, breakfast in a nice room and plenty for our needs.

And I agree with the other reviewer that you had to practically beg the front desk staff to give you a map or act friendly. They were sort of \"aloof\".   We had just come from Rome where we stayed at the Hotel Napolean. They had been very friendly at that hotel and greeted us by name every day, so we were somewhat put off by the bland hospitality at the San G.   However they did come to our rescue when we went on to Venice and discovered that we had left our nice digital camera hanging on a chair back in the room.

The hotel has no parking area, so think twice if you'll rent a car because you have to pay 20 euros extra per day!!!! The hotel is in a driving-restricted area, so it took us 3 hours to find the hotel!
