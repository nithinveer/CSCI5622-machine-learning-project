The memories are overall pleasant. The location, adjacent to the Galata Bridge, was ideal for us. Sultanahmet was accessible on foot. We had ample opportunity to sit late at the scenic Karakoy. Galata Tower was half a Km. There were plenty of lunch/dinner/breakfast options and a money exchange right outside the hotel street. The room was spacious, and usually peaceful at night, with adequate furniture and storage space and a modern cooling option. The breakfast was probably adequate. Tea was available round the clock in the lobby. The staff members were always smiling and tried their best to tackle any issues/needs highlighted. Mr. Bora stood out for his command of English and booking an excellent sea cruise for us. There were a couple of negatives however. The lift was quite small and suffocating, barely accommodating the three of us. Second, there were problems with the washroom \u2013 lack of proper drainage and a faulty door lock. However, given the various advantages we will not mind returning to stay here.\u2026", "date": "October 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2298109-r630654982", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "IT WAS EXCELLENT!!", "review": "Read good and bad reviews but decided to take the plunge anyway. Booked 3 nights. Arrived way too early(06:30) for us to book in but the friendly young man at reception offered us coffee and tea. We left our luggage in a corner on the lobby and took a stroll along the Bosphorus quayside and Galata Bridge and returned at about 11. The good news was that he secured us a room so we could  book in and just rest our weary bodies  for a while. The room was small and had a small balcony with a table and 2 chairs. We ended up booking an extra night and found the room perfect for its purpose, sleep and shower. The breakfasts were adequate with a good selection of cheeses, olives, breads and juices, coffees and Turkish tea. Best of all is the situation of this hotel. Literally a minute or 2 walk to the karakoy iskelesi ( ferry station) or a similar walk to the tram station. You are literally next door to the Galata Bridge with its many restaurants and fisherman. If you like the area but want a more upmarket hotel consider the Ada Hotel Special Class in the same Street. The friendly staff win me over and we'll gladly stay there on our next visit.\u2026", "date": "September 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2298109-r615869229", "sub_review": {"Sleep Quality": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 4}, {"title": "WORST HOTEL EVER", "review": "it is located in the best place in Istanbul, the room was very clean and the stuff was very friendly and kind. you can visit lots of places on foot due to its good location . it is very close to galatas bridge!", "date": "March 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2298109-r568537364", "sub_review": {"Sleep Quality": 1, "Rooms": 1, "Service": 1}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Perfect ", "review": "This is my 3rd time to Istanbul and my 100th time around the world and I have never been at a hotel this bad! Despite the location of the hotel everything was awful! me and my 2 other friends were crammed into the tiniest room, it can hold 2 people squished together so let alone 3 in the same room. The service was bad, I even asked for 3 extra pillows for each one of us because the pillows were so thin, yet the answer was we only have 2 left, we cannot do anything about it. So I had to sleep there for 4 days with an awful pillow.. I asked them how to get to the airport and they offered a taxi for like 60 euros or maybe a bit more with no other alternatives although I asked until someone walked in and told me to take the Hava Bus for 12 liras from Estiklal sq. so I asked the guy to order me a taxi at 5am to get to Estiklal he said it's close by you can just walk!!!!!!! Knowing that the walking distance is about 30 minutes while wheeling my bags there. I asked him again that I needed a taxi to be ordered at 5am and he said when you come down I will order one, breakfast awful, shower awful with no door or curtain so we shower and have water running all over the bathroom floor,  and people these are just the headlines, I can go on and on about the worst experience I have ever had, but this review will suffice for now.

I was booked on a cruise, and the hotel was near the port, but it was also close to everything else  The Turkish people were friendly and helpful, and the food was wonderful.

The hotels in Taksim are way more overpriced while Karak\u00f6y is 5 min away. It is also near the Goldenhorn and more close to Sultanahmet, its pretty close to every touristic place I ve been visiting like Galata Tower etc.   So after I spent a bit unnecessary money on Taksim's \"so called luxury hotels\" and didnt wanted to be keep robbed I decided to spend some of my time in Istanbul to find a cost efficient place. Therefore I checked the prices in the close hotels from tripadvisor. Karak\u00f6y generally seemed more cheap. I was gonna visit there anyway so end up visiting hotels in that area and find this one with very authentic entrance.
