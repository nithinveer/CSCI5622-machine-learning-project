Me and my cousin, arrived early at the hotel which they allowed us to keep our bags in the back until our room was finish. We requested early check in, and poolside room on the ground level. Just a warning, if you are not an iguana or gecko person. Please do NOT request ground level as this is a known species in Fort Lauderdale area. Once our room was finish about 2pm. The rest of the evening went well. They do provide a shuttle service from the hotel and to the hotel within 3 miles radius. So this is also a nice complimentary to the guest. Also, we even got drinks made down at the bar which was awesome. The next day, me and my cousin ran errands for about 4hrs. Just prior to leaving for the morning , we notice the housekeeper was like 2 doors down from our room cleaning. Well, 4hrs later we return back to our room not being touched or cleaned. The housekeeper was across in another room. So when asked, why is our room still not refreshed when you were a couple doors down hours ago. She stated we were next. Around 2pm, the housekeeper finally came. Not a big deal, Right! We just didnt let it bother us. Well the next day is when the disaster happen. While getting ready for the morning. My cousin was in the next bed. All of a sudden I notice this big brown bug on her bed. I screamed, and my cousin hopped out of bed. She suffers from panic attacks so my scream freaked her out. She said what is it. I said OMG there is a cockroach on your bed, hanging on the sheets. She barely could catch her breath. So I called the front desk and ask if they can have someone come to room 111. There is a big brown bug in one of the beds. After waiting almost 5 mins for someone to come. I had to calm my cousin down because she was freaking out and couldnt catch her breath. When the janitor guy came and hit it. The cockroach was trying to crawl back under the mattress between the sheets. After he killed it. We requested to be move to another room. The front desk staff was very apologetic and nice BUT the length of time to get another room was again a long time. 2hrs of waiting in the entertainment lounge area when clearly the accommodation could have been handle quicker in our instance. Not only did they say they did not have any 2 queen bed rooms avaliable. They said it was only a king room on the 5th floor. Well just receiving another room and a complimentary drink in this instance just wasnt enough. After mentioning a refund of a night stay. The lady at the desk mentioned she has to put it through with her manager. My cousin was so freaked out she just was terrified to lay in the bed. Please be aware this staff is friendly, however, the wait time is ridiculous and not just because of our room change but housekeeping and the shuttle service as well. We waited about an hour for a shuttle to come back and get us when the front desk staff kept saying he on his way. It took 3 calls to try to get an eta which end up being an hour. The cockroach was the icing on the cake for us. To know that a cockroach was in the bed with u for however long is disgusting especially to someone who suffers from anxiety. This hotel is not the best in Fort Lauderdale. There is better. Plus I recommend getting a rental to drive to places. It's like a 15 min drive to the main beach of Fort Lauderdale. I would not stay here every again. Highly disappointed. The staff was friendly but the rooms are not the best. I would definitely recommend to look elsewhere. Update: The hotel end up sending my cousin a email, apologizing for what occurred. They did end up giving us 2 nights free of our visit. So basically a 2 night refund. Marriott is a great company, never had issues staying at any other of their hotels but this one was just a terrifying experience.\u2026", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d84433-r722391514", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 2}, {"title": "More for a Business Traveller", "review": "Dear Vettaboo623,  Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for your review.

I understand how frustrating it can be to not receive the room type you desired, experience water shutoffs when most needed, be inconvenienced by construction noise and, to top it off, not receive the warm and welcoming service you deserve.  I would certainly be upset too! Undergoing a renovation is probably one of the most challenging issues a hotel manager has to deal with, as we strive to offer guests a seamless experience while improving the hotel to better meet their needs. In an effort to do so, we constantly need to manage the unexpected, such as water shutoffs. When necessary, we work with the contractors to perform them when they will cause the least inconvenience and we try to inform our guests as soon as we are aware, but inevitably someone may be affected. I am truly sorry we were not able to offer you that seamless experience. I have re-iterated the start time of \u201cno earlier than 9am\u201d with the contractor and his team.  Equally, a renovation can be taxing on our team members, who otherwise would handle a situation properly and gracefully. However, there is no excuse for not making our guests feel valued and appreciated. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, as I will spend some extra training time with our team to ensure our guests receive the impeccable service that is expected from a Marriott Hotel.  I truly hope that, once we are completely renovated with the Courtyard Refreshing Business and totally re-designed rooms, you will consider giving us another chance to show you we can be one of the Marriott\u2019s you love.

The hotel is undergoing a full property improvement plan that includes not only updating the room d\u00e9cor, but completely replacing the bathrooms, installing lavish showers and walk-in closets, and a full hallway makeover with bright white doors and enhanced lighting for a truly refreshing experience. In addition, our entire lobby and meeting space will be transformed! The challenge is to do all this work while minimizing the impact it has on our in-house guests! Thanks to your feedback, we have revised the renovation notice in the rooms to better reflect our current timeline.  We are excited to share that our 5th floor has been completed and the feedback from our guests has been outstanding!

I appreciate you contacting me directly after your week-long stay with us, since we take these matters very seriously. Immediately after our conversation, we read the room locks and the record showed that there was no unauthorized entry from the time of your arrival until the housekeeper cleaned the room at 3pm the following day. As discussed over the phone, I recommended you report the situation to the Fort Lauderdale Police Department and offered to assist you in that process. We have received your letter detailing the incident and have forwarded to our headquarters for review. The response will be sent to your e-mail, for privacy matters.  I apologize for the confusion upon check-in regarding the additional authorization of funds. It is common practice for hotels to authorize a determined additional amount on credit cards upon arrival to cover incidental charges. This is the same process with debit cards, but in this case it engages the funds, until the hold is released a few days later. This is why we notify our guests in advance during the check-in process. In this particular case, when our Front Desk Manager called your bank internationally, she was informed that they did not have a hold on your debit card for additional funds.  Your observations were also shared with our Housekeeping Team and appropriate disciplinary action was taken. Please forgive us for providing you with a sleeping room that was less than perfect.

I am sorry you did not find this offering a value added amenity as do the majority of our guests and local area neighbors.

I can understand your frustration when not having a good night\u2019s sleep in the mattress type of your choice.  In an effort to provide our guests with a better sleeping experience, we are in the process of upgrading our bedding to soft, plush, pillow top mattresses, which are certain to better suit our customer\u2019s preferences.  Our bathroom amenities are intended for a two to three time use and our standard rooms are prepared with three bath towels, two hand towels, and two washcloths. Of course, it is our pleasure to provide more as requested.  The hotel\u2019s d\u00e9cor was specified and approved by the Marriott Corporate Design team. I am sorry to learn that it is not your liking.  We have had our pool towels available at the Front Desk for many years, and to our knowledge, it had never posed an issue. I really appreciate you bringing this to our attention and we will certainly consider adding a sign that provides more direction to our guests.  I apologize for any disruptions in the morning. Our rooms are equipped with door closures that prevent these from slamming. However, when additional force is used, it may create some sound.  We provide both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today newspapers, Monday thru Fridays, except on Holidays. These are available at the Front Desk on a first come, first serve basis. We normally order more than is usually consumed to ensure that our guests are pleased. I am deeply sorry if that day was the rare one we had much more demand than expected.    With the increase in internet usage and the size of downloads, our maximum band width is reached in peak times. We are in the process of updating our complimentary high speed internet access to provide faster services to our guests. I truly am sorry for any inconveniences these may have caused.  Thank you for your compliments on our staff. We do pride on our team and it is always a joy to learn that our guests are receiving the excellent service we strive to provide.

It is with comments like yours that we are able to better accommodate our guest needs.

We have contacted our Internet provider iBAHN, who found that we had high guest connectivity and we were reaching our limits of bandwidth. We have worked with our provider and have significantly increased our bandwidth, allowing our guests to have the high-speed internet connection that is expected.    Again, I am sorry for the coffee machine in the room not working and that you were not satisfied with our cooked-to-order breakfast buffet. I am certainly surprised, since we normally get high compliments on the food quality and service.  Thank you for your pointers on our front desk personnel. We are constantly working hard at training and will continue to do so.  If you are ever in the Fort Lauderdale area again, I would sincerely hope you would give us another chance.

We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you encountered during your stay.  The Courtyard Fort Lauderdale East was in deed converted, according to Courtyard Brand standards, from a Howard Johnson, and this is why our rooms have dual vanity areas, and are larger and more spacious than most new constructions.  After researching why your confirmation and the system had two different rates, we found that since you made your reservation, the rate at which you had reserved you room had increased. When performing an internal transaction, the system read the new rate instead of your original rate and that is what was charged. I can understand how frustrating this could have been and I apologize for not noticing ahead of time.  We are glad our staff was able to correct the rate difference when it was brought to their attention.  Through your valuable feedback we have conducted training with the Maintenance and Housekeeping Departments reinforcing the need to ensure that everything in the room, is always working properly.

The bathroom needed a good clean (to remove someone else's pubic hairs from the bathtub) but we didn't bother to mention this to the front desk as we had just spent 9 hours on a flight to Miami followed by 2 hours waiting in line at immigration and we were exhausted. When we asked for directions to restaurants on the beach we were told by the front desk that it would be a ten minute walk. We fancied a drink so we left the car behind and walked for 30 minutes (briskly, and we are both over 6 feet tall so\u2026", "date": "July 2005", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d84433-r4163364", "sub_review": {"Value": 1, "Rooms": 2, "Cleanliness": 2, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 2}, {"title": "July 4th Weekend", "review": "I just stayed at this hotel over the July 4th weekend. I did all the hotel arrangements through Marriot's website. I recieved a fantastic rate in conjunction with my AAA auto club discount. Location of hotel is on a major intersection (Commercial Blvd. and US1). ***The hotel is not near the beach. There is restaurant in the hotel and a Denny's across the street. Rooms are large, very clean with a modern upscale decor (finally no pastels!!!). Beds are very comfortable, down pillows. There is cable TV, pay per view movies and a Bose wave alarm clock radio. In addition, there is a in-room coffee maker, small refrigerator, iron and a wall safe. ***Highly recommend getting a room facing the back parking lot, otherwise you will be subject to constant road noise.

Lauderdale.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious.   I particularly liked the firm mattresses.  So often  Florida hotels  have mattresses that are worn out.   This hotel is tech friendly with free computer/internet access for laptops. Few hotels go out of their way to accomodate guests like this one. I needed a few more pillows and within 2 minutes I had 4 more.  Staffing is one of the best qualities. Breakfast is hearty and worth the $8.   If you enjoy swimming, the pool is great.
