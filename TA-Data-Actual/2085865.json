The manager, Aylan, was my contact from the time I made the reservation until we departed. Upon request he arranged transportation to and from the airport, greeted us upon arrival and helped us plan activities and good places to eat during our short stay.     Located in the center of the Old City, we easily walked to the Grand Bazaar and other major attractions.    We loved our room that had a comfortable bed, complimentary breakfast, and nice shower.Upon returning to the hotel we were greeted by friendly and helpful staff and cookies in the dining area.
