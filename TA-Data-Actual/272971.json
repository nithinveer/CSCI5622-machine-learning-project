[{"title": "Alternative hotel - Rooms lovely", "review": "We visited Palma last week and on arrival to our hotel we found that they had double booked us. We were then asked to spend two night here at the Hotel Serrano. Our other hotel has also upgraded our stay to half board so we got to experience breakfast and evening meal here at the hotel. On arriving late afternoon on our first day we went around the pool and paid 15 euros to use the 4poster bed as they had no sun loungers left. We only used this for a couple of hours which would of been nice if they had let us have it for half the price but not to worry.  The room we stayed in on the 3rd floor was really nice. Lovely big bathroom with double sink and bath. Nice touch with flip flops and robes for our stay. The air conditioning was very good.  We had a room that overlooked the pool and It was nice to sit out on an evening. The food was ok and a nice buffet.  We had an all inclusive stay at the other hotel which I have reviewed and that was a 4* hotel and the food was nice there then at the Serrano. The food did let the stay down. The restaurant was a little dark, no outdoor seating.  The safe were friendly and when we checked in offered us a glass of bubbles and truffle. Lovely touch.  Very German hotel and we didn't come across another English person while staying in this part of the island. The room was the best part of this hotel.  Nice stay but I wouldn't book any package other than just bed and breakfast. Not far to walk to the front and have meals in the nice restaurants we saw while out. We only stayed for 2 nights so didn't get chance to experience any entertainment.\u2026", "date": "August 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580283-d272971-r608878577", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Old fashion hotel without any charm.", "review": "Dear Guest,  thank you very much for the positive review.

We found the hotel to be of a very impressive standard. the standards of cleaning in the rooms were great -fab towels, great air con, good bbc channels, beds and bath robes- and choc on pillows at night! and we were lucky enough to get a see view balcony which made all the difference- probably the difference between if you think the hotel is worthy of 5 stars! ( i suggest coming up with a line such as 'need room to be away from reception and roads might mean you also get one at no extra cost!- other wise you can pay for one). the hotel itself was faultless, take some books and chill out by the pool also highly recomend taking a\u2026", "date": "June 2005", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580283-d272971-r3621215", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "pure pleasure", "review": "my partner and i booked this holiday on teletext and got a great deal. it was just a pleasure to stay there nothing was a problem for the staff. it was mostly german tourits at the time but we were by no means ignored or treat any different.  the nightlife was mainly german orientated but it also meant you had nobody hasseling you once they knew you were english. hotel rooms were lovely and we were presented on our first morning with a large basket of fruit, plates napkins and champagne. the pool was spacious and there was also a large seating pool area were staff catered to your every need. i would love to return for a really relaxing break.   oh and the hotel still sends a little christmas card reminder each year.

We didn't know anything about the resort or the hotel and turned up to be really, really suprised - it was fantastic.  The room was immaculate with the most stunning balcony overlooking the pool and the sea.  We were greeted by the most friendly reception staff who bent over backwards to help us.  The only slight drawback was the dining area - don't ge me wrong - the food was fantastic, but it was very, very quiet - you could only hear the sound of cutlery clinking but that was a very small price to pay for a lovely stay and admittedly we went in the low season.  The resort itself is really, really stunning.

If you want a detailed review, read on amigo...  The Hotel Serrano Palace is located in the resort of Cala Ratjada or Cala Rajada which roughly translates to Bay of Rays.  To get to the hotel from Palma airport, you can get a taxi... It will take you 1 hour 10 mins to get to Cala Ratjada and this will cost you 66 euros exactly. That's quite a lot of money just to be spending on transfers so try to get the transfer included in your holiday booking. If you do, you'll save yourself 132 euros!  The hotel is situated across the road from a little beach called Son Moll. Here there are some bars and restaurants where you can sip a cocktail or have lunch by the sea. I recommend the Malibu bar and restaurant. The food is very nice and the people are really friendly in\u2026", "date": "April 2005", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580283-d272971-r3429604", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Loved it", "review": "Me and my husband just came back from Mallorca and stayed in Serrano palace. I was a bit nervous about the food as I have read reviews here to say it was bad. I can only say it was very good dinner. Yes it was buffet style and you do not ge many 5* hotels with this. but It had a good rance of salads, oils, vinegars, cheeses, fruit, puddings, ice-creams. 2 types of cooked (with sauce) meats, 2 fish. 1 type of roast meat, and then a kind of area with a grill where they have either fresh meat or fish every night. veggies, veg option, and poatatoes never chips. Me and my husband thought it was very good and will definetly go back as rooms, and service couldn't be better.

The holiday is spotlessly clean, the rooms are big and nicely decorated. the holiday has lots of facilities which were all open and were not over crowded. The swimming pool was warm and clean with plenty of sunloungers - yes, the hotel was also full - so this wasn't because the hotel was empty. Staff at the hotel spoke good English and the food was exceptional. I would highly recommend this Hotel and can't wait to go back. Yes, Cala Ratajada is mainly German, but they were very friendly and all the bars in the town catered for the English as well. The town has a nice high street with 2 - 3 nightclubs which were still going strong at 5am! if you are considering the Serrano Palace\u2026", "date": "April 2004", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580283-d272971-r2218178", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}]
