[{"title": "Beware the Bay Wing", "review": "There's a reason that there are little to no photos of the Bay Wing featured in any of the marketing material by The Waters, it's a hulking old building where about 40% of the rooms look out onto a grey concrete wall or a staircase. None of the rooms or the pool receive any sun at any time of day. The sunbathing spot for the poor souls of the Bay Wing is a lawned area with insufficient sunbeds that's positioned over the dirty water exchange so has a slight sewage smell.  This really is two resorts. The water access rooms looked amazing and I'm sure the people in those rooms write glowing reviews - we asked to upgrade but the front desk (who were never very helpful) just kept telling us the standard rate for the room, not the upgrade rate.  The bar is really expensive - 95 baht for a small chang - most people just went to the shop next door - 45 baht for a small chang - and bought beers and drinks for a fraction of the cost and drank those around the pool - nobody seemed to mind.  The hotel is all about \"The Concept\" and \"The Joy\" but this isn't the case in the bay wing.  Breakfast fine.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297914-d3546777-r728322338", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Lovely place ", "review": "We stayed here recently as a family of 4 with 2 teenage girls and we were very happy with our choice of hotel, being our first time in Thailand we were really pleased we chose a great hotel like this. The hotel has everything you need for a relaxing holiday,  games room, gym, restaurant, numerous pools, pool bar, shop, laundry facilities. We booked 2 deluxe rooms and were given 2 water pool access rooms where you can just open your balcony door and the pool is on your doorstep, absolutely fantastic to have this from your room, the bed is huge and very comfortable with choice of soft or hard pillows, air con brilliant no problems,  free safe, bathroom towels and pool towels provided free of charge, TV in room with many channels but only used channel 8 for English news (not a problem as didn't go all the way to Thailand to watch tv, large shower which worked really well, they provided bath robes, flipflops and umbrellas which were very useful out of the 10 days we stayed we only had 2 days of constant rain, a god send in a way to cool down and give the sunburn a break!! Although still very humid. The hotel is very clean and tidy as were the pools, our house keeper Kira was very good  and left our room lovely and clean,  all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful smiling throughout the day greeting everyone also Tony from the pool bar was very friendly, the restaurant staff were very nice working hard looking after everyone, the hotel is not far from the beach about 10min leisurely stroll and there are plenty of restaurants and bars in the area all walking distance,  we are so glad we chose this hotel as it had everything we needed and more for a fantastic holiday in Thailand, we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone,  thankyou The Waters!!\u2026", "date": "August 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297914-d3546777-r699904538", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "GREAT !

Stayed in a top floor pool access room (1322) which we loved, we thought it better than the swim up rooms, as you obviously didn't get people swimming past your balcony looking in ! Massive comfy bed, great shower & kept clean by the lovely cleaners. Amazing selection at breakfast, which certainly sets you up for the day.

I've seen the pool access rooms and they are not my style. Bland decor with poor quality furniture.
