[{"title": "Fantastic visit!", "review": "My family, friends and I had the best visit last week at Grand Mercure Phuket Patong!  The service from the time we arrived and was met at the front desk by Orn, Fon, Bond, Pangko and JT was 5 star!  One of the travelers on our vacation had problems with her leg and we were worried that it was something serious, we went to the front desk and their attention was prompt and considerate as they connected us with a doctor for medical advise immediately. The location is 5 minutes from Bangla Road, and the amenities are top notch.  Our rooms were clean, modern and had nice views. We were a party of 10 and was well accommodated with rooms located near each other.  In the end we finished off our stay with a visit to Ryn Spa and was greeted by Golf and staff. Having breakfast included was a plus and the variety of food was great and delicious My husband and I had an amazing couple romance package, with body scrub, wrap and massage.  Superb!  Kudos, Grand Mercure!\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297930-d6390760-r729276540", "sub_review": {"Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Great employees!", "review": "I am writing this review because i really hope this will reach the excellent staff!   Ive planned my stay at the Mercure because I am an accor employee in NL so ive orientated my travel throughout thailand around accor chain hotels.   When we arrived here it was our fourth hotel of the month. We got informed about the deposit that was 1000 baht per night. We were staying here for 6 nights so it was a pretty big deposit, maybe a bit too big.  We explained to the frontoffice manager Ann (idk if she is, but if she isnt, she should! Ill get to that later) that it was too much and that it was a big cut in our budget. She found an excellent sollution for us.  Later when we got in the room, there were nice flowers and a nice cake because of our anniversary.   As for the f&b department.. The ladies from the breakfast, they were so nice! As our stay was 6 nights they remembered who we were and greeted us so polite and really friendly every day.   Fast forward to our last day. We asked for a late checkout because our flight was not until the evening. We first heard that it was not possible. We understand that.   Very unfortunatly my partner got sick. -not because of the hotelfood!- as i went to the breakfast for the last time, the ladies recognized me and asked why i was alone, i explained them that my partner was sick. I hope i dont violate any privacy rules but I remembered the name of Ying because she provided excellent service! She got a foodpoison-proof breakfast and employees helped me getting the breakfast to the room!   I was also a little panicked, because we had a plane to catch while my partner is nearly dying and I was not sure if he was able to fly.. and there was Ann again to help me out! She immediately provided us with a late check out and she even wrote a letter for me in Thai with exactly what I needed! I went to the pharmacy with the letter and they helped me splendidly! I received pills for nauseous, stomachache and a supplement for minerals and vitamins.  I have never experience this kind of personal service! Because of the hurry we were in, i tipped a little small.... so IF you stay at the Grand Mercure in nov/dec 19? Please leave a tip in your room for the housekeeping as they deserve it so much!!!!\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297930-d6390760-r729045745", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Excellent", "review": "The villa and service was very excellent and we are very exciting \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbSpecial thank to Pimmy and Oil for special Coconut juice and birthday cake.

Our Team members are dedicated and sincere in their approach and it is for that exact reason i can't agree on our Breakfast being average either...   Again, this is a very subjective matter and it would depend on each and everyone's own tastes and preferences. And with this in mind, our Executive has been working for the last few months and years on constantly improving our offer and selection, offering tastes and flavors for all, from healthy picks to freshly squeezed fruits and vegetables juices, local bites trolley outdoor to freshly made Phuket-style coffees and teas, asian noodle stations or european classics, daily made bakeries and breads by our Pastry Chef Mon', salads and cold cuts, vegetarian specialties as well as Hallal products to fit all diets and preferences...  Following you comments made to Khun Ann, she also took the initiative of offering few \"extras\" and all i believe would be worth a little more than 3* but again, it depends on each and everyone's judgement and i hope next time we will be able to please you both fully :)  Many thanks again and wishing you a wonderful rest of the year!!

There were options like dal makhni and paneer with naan. One day they had poha which was just tasteless. And one day stale idlis with no sambhar or chutney. I guess u should keep only 1 or two items but they should be eatable.

He's also part of our new Owner's project, coming up shortly and from what i understand, same concept will apply....

Just got back from our stay yesterday and will definitely miss it.   Here\u2019s what we found -   Check in - Welcoming lovely staff. The drink and little sweet treat given on check in with cold towels was delicious! I do think you are asking way too much for a deposit for the rooms though and to have it based on how many days you stay is a bit crazy. It\u2019s like punishing those that stay longer? 1000 baht per day is the deposit required in cash or credit card. It was just a bit of a shock to me, I\u2019ve never paid that much before. I know it gets refunded after your stay, just seems like a lot. We had three rooms, we arrived early and they had two ready for us to check in early which was nice.

I am very sorry about what appears to be a disappointing experience at ours and wish we could have discussed those matters together while at the property.  Please note i have shared your comments with our concierge team last Friday already and we will work on improving service from the moment guest enter to the moment they leave... A good and sincere farewell is important and definitely a good wake-up call thank you.   As for the room size and variety of our breakfast, i wish to share a few things with you if you do not mind... You recommended future guests to maybe look for alternatives while we do have plenty here to offer :)  Deluxe in other parts of the world might indeed be bigger in size but none would offer direct and unique access to the pool. Our Deluxe are 28sqm plus an additional 6sqm for the sundeck. A vast majority of our guests enjoy those very much as they are by far our best sellers.  For those preferring tranquility and space, our Suites could be an option (62sqm and balcony), our one or two bedroom villas another (115sqm and 220sqm respectively)?  There are plenty of options for everyone to chose from i can ensure you.   As for vegetarian options at breakfast, we have lately very much improved our offer for guests with specific diet or not. Guests looking for vegetarian options, european delicacies, asian bites but also Hallal or Glutten free products would be pleased at ours as we are trying to cover all sort of cuisines and tastes.   Yes we could always improve, but as a vegetarian, you could have easily daily from greens and our salad corner, cereals stand with 4 different kinds of milk (though Vegan might not really like this option), our entire sliced and whole fruit station, our lovely bakeries made with French butter, our Indian/Oriental corner with 2 specialties rotating daily, our Cheese Board, Local Phuket treat with coconut cakes and jellies or our Belgian waffle and pancake station outside... Daily we would also have vegetarian fried rice or noodles and porridge... Maybe it is simply due to the fact we are not marking those clearly enough and that might be confusing...   Anyway, i wish we could have offered you a relaxing and enjoyable time... I hope some other times :)  Merry Christmas and wishing you and your family a wonderful holiday season.

Depending on the style of cuisine you would be after (local or not so much), a meal would probably cost you anywhere between 200 & 400 THB. It is a lot less expensive in Krabi, as it is easier to step away from Beach road and snack at little local places there, where Thai food or street vendors would usually sell a meal for about 100-200THB only (Thai food).  But you can still find a lot of western-like restaurant and bistrot and prices are also very decent.  Soft drinks are inexpensive but Beers, liquors and wine are about the same price as it is in Europe for instance.   With a bit of shopping, a good breakfast and a few other meals and drinks, i would say about 1,200 to 1,500 per day. Tours and Excursions are what cost the most as a day trip to one of the island nearby would probably range between 2,000 & 3,000 THB per person.   Good luck and see you around very soon..

This is a great choice for couples and families;  close (10 min walk) to the beach and main shopping areas, restaurants, massages etc just outside,  and a wonderfully quiet hotel and great service. Rooms are clean and comfortable; the beds are quite firm but after one night i was used to it. If our room was any indication they are starting to need a bit of maintenance,  especially the wet areas, but still fine. The pool was pleasant but small and could be a little crowded at times,  but i loved the swim up bar. The breakfast buffet was great,  plenty of choices for everyone and efficient service.

She couldn't find our reservation and ws clearly frustrated with the process as the system was not showing our reservation. The finale straw came when she interrupted our group conversation rudely, despite we were trying to be nice and helpful to her.

We are very pleased to hear about your lovely stay and thank you also for the comments related to possible improvements in term of both service and offer.   I will surely thank our Kitchen team for their superb work and display during Buffet nights... I will also remind them to work on both variety and set-up as i do believe there are plenty options for Europeans (like you & I). It might simply be due to the fact that those are not visible enough to all... We have cold cuts and cheeses of premium quality, the classic English breakfast items we are all fond of and of course, outstanding bakery items such as croissants, waffles, brioches as well as 3 or 4 different quality of breads... If you add to this the cereal station, the fruits and juices offered and the few salads we call \"Oriental\" like tabouleh, Greek feta salad and other greens, there is really plenty for \"us\" to chose from.  Very valid point, thank you very much once again and rest assured we will work on those immediately.   The pool temperature is something a little more surprising for me i have to admit as the main pool temperature never ever went below 27*... regardless of the rain or sunny conditions... This morning, it was at 29* despite heavy rainfalls last night.  The weather outside is much much higher than the temperature of the pool, hence the felling of freshness entering in it i would think.   In regards to the 7,000THB you were asked for as deposit, please kindly that is a standard operating procedure for all Accor Hotels properties in Asia and that this amount represent 1,000THB per each night spent. It is not debited but simply blocked in order to cover miscellaneous expenses you and your partner may have had throughout the stay... receipt from Mini Bar, Spa, buffets and/or tours can then be deducted from that amount upon check-out.  I am sorry you were not informed earlier about that policy and will surely remind our team about the necessity of doing so, especially when a patron like yourself is giving us a chance to do so via email.

It is embarrassing but kindly rest assured that corrective actions have been taken already.  Luckily our team responded quickly and could assist you in switching room as requested... Giving us a chance to react to a situation or help you improve your overall experience is all we are asking for and i thank you for that opportunity given to do so.   The three rooms you mentioned about have all been checked and and are now back into our room inventory.Thank you very much once again.    I however found both the 2* rating and latest comments about value for money to be little severe if I may say. If you remember correctly, you did not move twice but simply once as our Front office Supervisor offered you the choice between 2 rooms that are almost next to each other (#634 & #637).  It was a good initiative and its purpose was simply to make sure you would be entirely satisfied with the switch. Our Supervisor also automatically upgraded you to Club status which meant complimentary access to our VIP lounge daily.   As for the value and Hotel rating itself (3*), i am a little puzzled about these other options you mentioned about, at half price of ours? Properties that would offer you friendly service and care (especially when you are facing unpleasant issues); properties that would offer such tranquil and serene atmosphere as well as meals and breakfast options like we do. You mentioned about the variety offered at breakfast and while other properties might opt for additional rotations (on a smaller and less qualitative selection), we chose to offer everyone the largest selection of American, Continental, Oriental, Diet & Vegetarian as well as Asian specialties there is... so to give every single guest of ours a vast array of tastes and flavors to choose from.   We are importing butter from Europe so to prepare fresh and delicious bakeries & croissants on daily basis (all bakeries and breads are in-house made). Our cold selection offers fresh Atlantic salmon (chilled), sushis & sashimis, salads and greens as well as Brie and 2 other kinds of hard and semi-hard dough cheeses imported from Europe...  Those are plated next to our cold cuts selection where again, costs are not spared and Italian salami, ham as well as chicken and smoked turkey slices are also on display. The Hot section is the one where rotations are mostly taking place, switching from fried noodles and curries to rice and other Thai dishes daily (10 dishes in total)... not forgetting the classics, such as sausages (2 kinds), beans and potatoes (English style, also rotating). To add spices, we created an Oriental corner with Vegetarian curries and Naan bread to once again please the very few guests of ours who would like a little change early in the day. If you add 4 different kinds of juices & 6 different kinds of sliced and whole fruits set on shelves, to the fact we are the only Hotel in Patong that does not charge extra for a real espresso, cappuccino or Iced tea, then it makes it i believe a very well suited breakfast to the vast majority of our patrons we are welcoming and serving daily.  We are all very sorry for all the inconveniences caused to you. We have in the past been able to turn things around if i may say and create fantastic connections and relationships with patrons following earlier disappointments... I sincerely hope you will be two of them and in future, giving us a chance to redeem ourselves and welcome you back at Grand Mercure... That is what we are hoping for and please rest assured i will be personally here to assist you, shall you change your mind and decide on visiting us once again...

I wish you would have simply mentioned it to me earlier, when we met at the Lounge as it is a Brand standard and and most if not all 4* and 5* throughout Thailand are applying the same procedure.   It is simply a deposit of THB 1,000 per night that is requested and we leave it up to our guests  to decide on whether or not they would prefer \"blocking\" the amount on their Credit card or simply deposing the amount at the Front desk cash. The later option is often picked as it means no bank transactions and guests can get their deposit back right away, upon check-out.   Anyway, i wish to ensure that we never charge our guest's credit card. We do block that particular amount simply as provision for miscellaneous charges you may have throughout your stay, like the cocktails and tapas you all enjoy at Craft for instance... The fact you left a deposit upon check-in means that you do need to carry money around and can simply sign for any bill and in any outlet (Bar, Restaurant, Ryn Spa, Tours, Tours and excursions).   I understand your surprise and i am once again very sorry for it... Please do not hesitate to email me directly next time you plan on visiting Patong...

It is always a pleasure to see happy guests returning to our property and we already look forward to your 3rd visit next year.   As for Hallal and food variety, i am a little surprised by your comments as we have been working on improving this particular aspect of our cuisine for the last 18 months. I am really sorry about that as we all understand how important it is, whether talking about Hallal food for our Muslim guests, vegetarian dishes for a few of our Indian customers or any other diet that might be requested.   I would think it comes down to a communication issue as we do provide Hallal food and meats on all levels. Our Chicken is supplied by the largest Thai corporation called CP. This company is Hallal certified and known around Thailand for being the first and still, only major supplier with such affiliation.  Our Beef is coming from Australia and our Lamb, from New Zealand, and both are also Hallal certified.   As you know well, Hallal is not only about the product itself, but the process and once again, we have followed special training courses here at the Hotel, with Phuket Islamic Institute. We have Muslim cooks and a dedicated set of kitchenware as well.   Please rest assured that we will brief the team once again and \"advertised\" Hallal dishes on both menus and breakfast buffet counters... so to re-insure all our Muslim guests in future.

To be honest, I am particularly pleased with your comments about the boutique service approach... \"I observed that this is the way they treat every single guest without exception\". Welcoming and serving well over 600 guests a day is a very challenging task and the given goal shared with the team upon opening this beautiful property was to offer boutique-like services and experiences, while operating a much larger than boutique-like property, with 314 rooms and villas. We might not be able to reach every single guest of ours daily, but reviews like yours, and the few other \"excellent\" ones we are receiving on regular basis, mean the World to us.

Firstly, we picked this hotel for its close proximity to Jungceylon shopping mall, massage joints and street shopping.

The hotel do provide shuttle service to the beach, Jungceylon and Central Festival mall. It is also not too far from the beach.   Secondly, as the hotel is relatively new, the rooms are clean and nicely decorated. Which makes it a comfortable stay just to chill around in the hotel.

We didnt like the look of the swim up rooms with direct access from the pool as everyone else would be looking at your terrace, so not private.  Our room had a Juliette balcony. Only very few of the top floor rooms have a real balcony. We always ask for a higher floor so we are out of reach of mosquitos.

Usually, guests in transit would consider Hotels closer to the airport, especially at this time of the year where occupancy is raising and traffic can at time be a real concern.   It is a great initiative by the local authorities to allow Taxi meters at the airport and indeed, their rates are usually better than the taxis from Patong or even our Hotel limousines... I would highly recommend future guest of ours to consider those services rather than opting for a \"non-licensed' operator once landing at Phuket airport. It is \"usually\", of better value and also safer.  I have also shared your comments in regards to the room upkeep. Our Housekeeper is investigating and will take suitable measures shortly.   Thank you also for your great comments about our room service and food selection at night.  As for the late check-out charge, it is usually based on the \"rate of the day\" so to keep it consistent and fair to all.

More than the few issues you had to go through, i am devastated by the fact you stayed 2 weeks with us and none of us, at the executive level, managed to meet with you even once, so to see how things were going or if there was anything we could have assisted you with. This is a procedural issue i will address in person shortly.   I am also very sorry to hear that housekeeping standards went from great to \"not so good\" overnight. I would really like to hear from you more about this and help us address this concern in a more effective manner. I called for a meeting yesterday with our Executive housekeepers and the 3 ladies that were assigned to your floor during your 14-day holidays and they all have an excellent record with us to be honest... with 2 of them being mentioned by guests on many different occasions.   I would also seek your assistance in reviewing timing and performance of our Room Service team too. In our cashier system (which is computerized), your waiter \"closed\" your bill at 8.47 pm, meaning the food was served prior to that time and therefore, i am a little concerned about the \"actual time of order\". I reviewed the time of delivery thanks to the cameras on the corridors and it was just before 8.45pm. It can happen that orders are queuing on the kitchen pass... but not to that extend and regardless of the delivery time, the fact you were charged is beyond me... I could not even believe it going through your review.   If you do not mind, i will send you an email separately and discuss those unfortunate issues with you personally.

Very pleased to see you both had a great stay despite the very high occupancy the Hotel was enjoying during that period and the busy breakfast times...   Patong and Phuket as a whole is seeing a switch in its own clientele mix and with Phuket's Airport now deserving most Asian capitals directly, it becomes very convenient if not easy for young couples and families to come over to Phuket for a few days only. We are seeing the average length of stays reducing to about 4 nights only against the 10-12 nights average Hotel were accommodating only a few years ago.  Thanks to our positioning, we can still maintain a good balance, between holiday makers coming from Europe, Australia or the States and other Asian clients probably coming on for a weekend or few days holidays only (like short break away from capital cities).  Our Middle East clients are usually visiting Thailand in July & August, when the temperatures are at their highest in their home country so altogether, we are still very happy with the way things are evolving in the entire region and are adapting our team to new requirements as well (multi languages, new cuisine orientations, room amenities...etc).

It was important for us not to have guests squeezing by the pool, like it is the case in some other resorts around Asia and that is why you may feel it is quite a waste.

I am sincerely sorry we could not please you fully nor ensure you and your partner with an authentic 5* experience during the only night you spent with us.  It is indeed difficult for us to address issues guests might be facing within such a short period of time and while operations should be running very smoothly by now, we still need to monitor those very closely so to avoid such disappointment in future. Really sorry for that and I wish you could have simply contacted our Front office at time as we could have easily moved you to another room and compensate you eventually with a late check-out or else.   I have also discussed with our Bartenders at the pool a few minutes ago and they mentioned they had added an extra shot into your cocktails following your remarks. We also did the same with the fruit platter which was apparently not to your liking.  As mentioned, we are here to serve and are pleased to help when requested to.   Regarding your comment about our concierge services, i am glad you both enjoyed the diving so much. That is great to hear.  It might however be a little different from diving spots but in Phuket at least, it is a very common practice to let guests and divers discussed details of their coming trip or journey together.  Such details as padi levels, suit & fin sizes, what tank size works best and any other details that might make this dive even more enjoyable are helping diving instructors keeping the dive safe and most pleasant.   Once again, i am very sorry you felt it was a lack of service from our team. it was not the intention at all.

Let me know next time you plan on visiting us and i will be happy to offer you a little discount for any of those treatments :).  Thank you once again and see you again soon.

Considering this, your comments are even more appreciated as it is definitely an area to look into.  I am living at the Hotel myself and surf on the web most evening without difficulties, using the \"free\" link too.   Even though it would be a great way of creating additional revenues for the hotel, i am asking our team to concentrate their \"up-selling\" efforts on other services in the restaurant and Spa for instance as we well aware of the fact that wifi is not even considered as an added value but yet another \"included\" service nowadays.  People often don't even realize or ask about it anymore as most if not all of our guests would expect high speed for free anyhow.

It seems you were having a great time up to that very last request and it is very annoying to see efforts of the entire team ruined in such a way. I wish we could have meet or discuss this point directly as I firmly believe in the fact that each problem, has a solution.   I am sure you noticed in previous comments that we are usually very accommodating when it comes to late check-out, when the occupancy allows us to do so however. During high season and for pool access rooms and villas mostly, it is not always easy to manage such request. We are trying to please short and long stayers but also need to get ready for new arrivals too.   I am sure you noticed a few comments about people having to wait for rooms past 2pm and this issue is sometime due to \"late check-out/cleaning of the room/new arrival schedule\" mismanagement.  The pool access rooms are in extremely high demand and allowing anyone a late check-out, at whatever price, when occupancy is very high, puts actually immense pressure on the team not knowing arrival time of the \"next\" guest for that particular room (we only have 38 of those ones).  With high season rates and the fact we did not have any spare room available means that rates are going up and following up the same principal of half day rate being 50% of daily and full rate, it came to 3,600 Baht (as we were selling THB 6,100+++ on that day, and still today).  I wish we would have simply explain that a late check-out on that day was unfortunately not possible in those rooms and offered you alternative options instead (like a superior room at around 70+++ dollars).  Please rest assure our intention was to find a way to please you, somehow, and the complimentary late check-out given until 2pm at the end, was to some extend, a way of doing so.  I would be very happy to look into your booking requirement personally, shall you decide on giving us another chance to welcome you...  with Grand regards, Sebastien", "date": "October 2014", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297930-d6390760-r239064164", "sub_review": {"Value": 2, "Location": 4, "Sleep Quality": 3, "Rooms": 3, "Cleanliness": 2, "Service": 3}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled solo", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Excellent stay", "review": "Worth every dime.

Miss Mareeya is always one step ahead, and she and all the staff really make the difference every single day. I recommend room 138 if available, slightly hidden and thus even more precious.

I believe arriving at the hotel and experiencing such heavy rain from start did not help with overall experience and i apologize for that.  Our Hotel was actually built 6 meters off the street level to help with monsoon's flood that are occurring heavy years and it was our decision not to have bus dropping off guests right in front of the lobby, to avoid exhaust emissions and other noise pollution affecting every other guest experiences. It is not the first time we are welcoming leisure groups or corporate teams and as always, our entire team would provide buggy transfers for luggage and welcome drink upon arrival at the lobby. It is a 50 meter walk and unless there is a heavy storm, the journey is usually being handled smoothly.  Thank you also for your good comments about the team and overall property lay-out... we thought guests would enjoy an extra 6 sqm. indoor rather than on the balcony, knowing our pool side Bar features not less than 100 sun loungers for the few guests who would appreciate a hot sun bath and a refreshing drink by the pool.  As for the ashtrays, please rest assure i am constantly chasing the team to keep the common areas as clean as it can get. It is unfortunate but by Thai regulations, smoking in the hotel premises is strictly forbidden, even outdoor. Therefore, we are providing ashtrays a few meters away from the main Hotel entrance, just far enough not to put the Hotel Management at fault, yet ensuring smokers with a suitable solution.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank you for all those constructive comments and hope to see you here again very soon...    with Grand regards, Sebastian", "date": "October 2014", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297930-d6390760-r238430163", "sub_review": {"Value": 3, "Location": 4, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Absolutely stay here when visiting Patong Beach", "review": "New facilities which are modern but hotel not running efficient yet.

I am personally very sorry about the inconveniences caused during your stay, whether when the blackout occured or when your toilet broke down.  These things can unfortunately happen but as you correctly mentioned, the fact we couldn't anticipate and compensate you accordingly is a totally different matter, for which we are usually very accomodating... especially during these first few months of operations.  To come back to the blackout and generator use, it did happen twice last week and while the municipality was working on fixing the main supply line, we automatically switched into \"generator mode\". I am not sure if you are familiar with the terms (no worry, i wasn't either until joining), but we have one of Phuket's most powerful generator in comparison to our number of room. It's a 1,200KW unit that provides electrical supply to all the rooms (emergency lights in rooms x2 and fresh air instead of air-conditionned), the lobby, the lifts and corridors, the surrroundings like walk ways and the restaurants.   Those are unfortunately happening quite often in Phuket (and any other city than Bangkok) and i can ensure you none of the property on the island, whether a 4 or 5* could have provided enough power to supply all rooms (as if nothing had ever happened).   I understand the frustration as i was myself in the lobby, discussing with a few \"surprised\" clients and appreciate the fact you understand it has absolutely nothing to do with us.   However, and wehn it comes to safety hazards and Housekeeping standards, it is our entire responsability and for those i have to present my appologies to you. I believe communication is important and i wish i could have had the chance of meeting you and discussing these matters with you directly rather than on this platform, maybe next time.  I did send you a personal appology note too so please feel free to contact me back shall you decide on giving our team and property a second chance...   Thank you once again.

Looking at the number of reviews you have made in the past, i believe it is a very obejective one and it will certainly help us improve in various areas.   Reviews received so far, from well travelled customers or new-comers to this Tripadvisor have mostly been outstanding to-date and it looks like unfortunately in your case... lots of things went wrong. I am really sorry for that and wish to appologize on  behalf of our entire team for the lack of attentiveness shown in various areas.  As you correctly pointed out, we are at about 70% of the hotel completion, still in soft opening period and while the remaining work consists mostly in wood and deco works, the team has lately been also working on some deffects in and outside the rooms. I was not aware of work being done at night as i am living in-house myslef but have asked our Chief Engineer to investigate this matter right away. This is indeed unacceptable but i can promise you it is not a usual habit of ours and it will be corrected shortly.  I am also very concerned about comments made in regards to check-in process. If there is one thing we have entire control over is our own selves and the attitude shown towards customers. I found this as unacceptable as the few other points mentionned above and will again look into this specific matter shortly.  Spa is the perfect exemple where friendliness and great service given by K.Da are compensating the inconvenience caused by external disturbances (to certain extend i agree). I will take this opportunity to thank Da for her friendliness and dedication shown.  As for the rooms, we are adapting to humidity and condensation caused by the air-conditionned unit and i have asked our team to again check on this.  I also wish to take this opportunity to thank you for your comments about the rooms and comfort of the beds. We specifically worked on providing great nights of sleep and quality showers, hoping that dedication and attentiveness from the team would ensure a fantatic tay for all.   Once again, very sorry we could not achieve this this time around and shall you decide on giving our team and property a second chance in future, please rest assured i will be more than happy to help with making it this time, a Grand stay afterall.  with Grand regards, Sebastien", "date": "July 2014", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297930-d6390760-r214816317", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Good location but poor housekeeping", "review": "The best thing about Grand Mercure is its location which is very close to the most happening places in Patong.

It is not entirely completed yet so i understand why you decided to go outside but i will be pleased to offer you a fantastic deal during your next visit :) Our prices are also very competitve and treatments of very high standards (we are actually creating our own Ryn fragrances).

I am very sorry to hear about this unfortunate incident that ruined the mood and the overall perception you had of the team and property up to that particular moment.   I can't appologize enough for that as i personally believe there is always a solution or way out to any issues we may face. The matter could and should have be dealt with in a different fashion and the last thing we wish for, is to have you and your wife, or any other guest leaving our premisces with mixed if not bad feelings. We are continuously working on improving our standards and this unfortunate experience will surely help us manage similar situation in a better manner in future.   There was no need for \"mattress\" or \"kettle\" references i agree and i have already discussed with Marya about this specific point. However, I have to say i am the one who set up this particular policy and the one who should be blamed for it. It is a very common practise in the industry and the reason they are being given away in some properties (maybe) is simply because they are either dispensable (low quality ones), budgeted for (accounted in the room rate offered). In our case, and in order to be able to offer both quality (and re-usable) amenities and very competitive rates in  a very competitive Patong area, we need to have such policies in place to manage the assets of the property and have every other guests enjoying their stay too.   Simply because we wish to keep our standards up high, we are keeping (well trying to) tight inventory of our assets and amenities. We keep record of the towels given by the pool, give the option to guests to purchase amenities they might have liked (elephant in room, bathrobe, slippers) and always find a way to please our guests anyhow.   I wish we could simply have offered you a good discount on the overall charge or eventually allow you to take the laundry bag along and pay for the slippers only....   I understand your frustration and the fact the entire episode made you and your wife very upset.  Please feel free to contact me directly next time you plan on visiting Phuket.

We really want to come back as soon as we can.", "date": "April 2014", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297930-d6390760-r201339086", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Excellent service and ambiance :)", "review": "Although this place just is opening, they did a very good job!

Grand Mercure definitely met what I required. All the staff are really really nice. They greeted and said hello to us  when we went out and came back to the hotel every time. Staff in the restuarant are friendly and helpful too. They had lovely smiles all the time.
