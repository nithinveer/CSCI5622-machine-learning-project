[{"title": "Visit to Italy ", "review": " We've never been to Italy before so this was a 1st for all of ower group, and I have to say it was amazing,we stayed at the Hotel Europa at Rva Del Garda right on the lake front. The hotel was superb we had an amazing time the food was very good although they could have had a change from scrambled or boiled eggs at breakfast but other than that we found no faults with quality, the rooms where comfortable although the single rooms I believe where a bit cramped not enough space for everything.     The resort itself was great plenty of bars and restaurants ,if you didn't have half board, not  cheap but then again we were told that Italy was expensive. We did a boat trip round the lake and stopped off at different towns, travelled to Venice well worth a trip it's a beautiful city and we did a gondola ride which is a must. Visited  Verona for the day,again it has a lot of history,saw juliet's statue and the balcony,and travelled up to the Dolomite what an amazing day that was.  All in all our holiday was amazing I don't think anyone could say anything negative about it. The best thing about the trip was the company we booked with all the trips where included in the price except the gondola which was extra but still worth doing it cost \u20ac20 per person which was booked by our guide who travelled with us daily on all the trips \u2026", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194883-d203229-r717655229", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Wine, food and lovely surrounds.", "review": "We stayed here over the festive season including seeing the new year in & the old one out.
