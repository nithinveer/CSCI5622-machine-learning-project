With that being said there were a couple things that bothered us:  1.  When we arrived they asked for our credit card and charged us $600 for incidentals.  I'm sure this is their policy, but a lot of resorts will amass charges and then charge at the end of the stay.  It feels weird to be charged $600 for services not rendered yet.  2.  Every charge at the resort is charged a service fee (@ 20%) so be careful that you don't \"tip\" again, unless you want to.  3.  We loved the beach and enjoyed that their was a waitstaff on the beach for drinks and food.  4.  The pool is a good size, with good depths for kids of all ages.  5.

Susan at the front desk was particularly wonderful, but each of the employees we encountered (at the beach, at the pool side restaurant, room service attendants) were  friendly, positive, and helpful.  Our room in Tower 2 had an amazing view, especially for sunsets.  The furnishings were in great shape; the room was very clean.  Only odd thing room-wise was when we asked for decaf coffee, we got K-cups.  Problem was the room had a traditional coffee maker.  We twice asked for either a Keuring pot or proper decaf for the coffee maker we had - it was promised twice and never delivered.  That is a small thing, of course.

You can also fill out a card with your play level and preference for singles/doubles/mixed and they will find you similar players to hit with. I\u2019m a 4.0 player and played doubles with two local members and another resort guest and we had a fun competitive match.

I was really upset, but she was so professional always with a calm smile.  Got us two other chairs and calmed me down.  I like the fact that they don't let people hold chairs when not there, however i was gone for 15 minutes.  The manager also came over to make sure we were ok.  The Tennis is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! Best Drills and Pros!! They make sure you get to play and even put you with someone that is looking to play.  My husband enjoyed playing golf as well.  Only one thing i might suggest for a guest, you might want to rent a car, as things are not close by.  So far our vacation is really great!!

The daily housekeeping was good and always had plenty of all that we'd need (towels, cleaning supplies for kitchen). The beach has suffered from erosion but we still enjoyed the water and view. The pool is nice- though we visited at peak times so it was definitely crowded. The staff- as always- was great. We never felt like just another guest- they tended to us swiftly and nicely.

The beach does have erosion but still so beautiful. Our unit was in building 6. We loved the pool and staff was super friendly. We used the complimentary bikes one day and liked them a lot. Loads of food options.   Only drawback was that they've implemented some sort of room temperature control so you can't set anything lower than 70 degrees. For most of our stay it was fine but the a/c in our unit wasn't great so the room felt humid and warm by our last night. Come summer with higher daytime temps, I could see a lot of feedback to the hotel that limiting the a/c isn't ideal though I'm sure it saves them $. They did offer us a box fan for our room which seems out of place at such a nice resort. I would think that $400+ a night, they can do better.\u2026", "date": "April 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34399-d84943-r362526364", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Amazing Beach Vacation!", "review": "This was a last minute trip to Longboat Key and the Resort at Longboat Key was the only place that had any availability for the week of spring break.

We arrived with our one year old daughter to a very run down and shabby room. The bath tub was stained and the whole suite in desperate need of renovation. The carpet was dirty and there was a half full coke can in one of the cupboards. The air conditioning was very noisy and would start every ten minutes with a big rumble from one of the cupboards. As a result I woke up in the night every time it went on! Completely unacceptable to have such an old fashioned system. One of the doors to the water tank had come off its runners and quite unsafe. The high chair that we asked for in our room was filthy around the bottom and I had to scrub it clean! The pool area was dirty and run down.

I appreciate your viewpoints and we will work to change your mind over future stays.  I will respond to your points as best as I can in order to hopefully offer another point of view.     I have been here 10 years and also have a long term perspective.  I understand that this year has been busier from an occupancy standpoint than some of the past years, partially due to marketing, partially due to property improvements and partially due to an improved economy.  I am very thankful for the millions of dollars new ownership has physically put into the property recently  to make improvements including wellness spa and fitness areas, golf courses, outdoor furnishings, etc. The Inn also improved the suites with new carpet, exterior and interior painting and other improvements.  I have had many conversations with repeat guests who recognized these improvements.  We do sometimes have beach events.  Typically weekends comprise of Wedding ceremonies that are usually a joy to watch from the suites and occasionally smaller private beach dinners, etc.  We do a couple larger beach evening events a year that may include entertainment and typically these are tied to a charity where we are raising money for a local charity while serving fabulous dinners and wine.  I am not sure when you were specifically here, so I cannot comment with full certainty of the event you mention.  I would be happy to speak to you further in detail on your experience, but our true desire is to provide an excellent experience for our guests.  I am sorry that we fell short on your most recent stay. Service and ambiance should always come first and I request you will give us another chance.

We do have additional meeting space in additon to what you mentioned.  We have the John Ringling room adjhacent to the hotel lobby as well as the library. We also offer meeting space in the Islandhouse location as well as a small meeting room in building 5.  Additionally, we have a grande ballroom located at our harborside complex as well as a small meeting room at our tennis Gardens.    I am a bit surprised that you felt the meeting room allowed noise from the lobby as the entry is very solid and I have not heard thei complaint before. That being said, I will find a busy check-in day and stand in the meeeting room to observe and make any adjustments needed.  The wifi in the meeting rooms are a multi-tiered network.  We have much faster bandwith available for meetings.  I\u2019m not sure who gave you the speaker cable but that is certainly unacceptable and  unexcusable.

The award winning tennis center is a short car-ride away, but we also offer tennis courts within walking of your suite.   On the cats, the Island does have cats.

I was travelling with a group and received breakfast vouchers for all 5 mornings. The problem was check-out. I was charged for $200 for the drinks that our group enjoyed Friday night. I was also billed for breakfast that same morning, which was itemized under 'lunch'. I contested both charges and called our group's travel agent who then gave authorization to transfer the $200 charge to the master account. Then, just this morning, I was going over my credit card statement and noticed yet another charge for $6.00. This  was for 'telephone, online communications\" for the day I was leaving.

The beach is wonderful - with an abundant # of cabanas free of charge.  The pool was exceptionally clear and easily big enough to accomodate all the guests.  The only issue I could find with the whole place is there was not enough available lounge chairs at the pool.

We have stayed at many beachfront properties, the difference at the LBKC is the lack or non-existence of service.  The resort charges a $25/night \"service\" charge per room.  There is also a 20% service charge with each drink and/or meal order.  What happened to rewarding quality of service rather than assuming your service is quality?  Even in a cashless resort, tipping can be done on each check.  The history of tipping is for a job well done, not because you showed up for work.
