Wonder how that's going for them? Anyway. Our daughter decided she fancied coming away with us this year and wanted to return to the Eriphilly as, and I quote, \"I need more room to be getting ready in\" Who am I to argue? I contacted Christos direct and booked two weeks from the end of July with him. In his next email he informed me we would be staying in the same room we had 11 years ago. Quite how he remembers that I'm not sure. But we were back in that very room! Anna was waiting to meet us when we arrived and even with the taxi reversing over our suitcase our spirits couldn't be dampened as we instantly settled into Greek mode, The room hadn't changed at all, but was spotlessly clean (as it was for the whole two weeks thanks to the excellent cleaner) although the daughter was convinced it was smaller...forgetting the 11 years since we'd last stayed in it! It's the Wagon Wheels thing.  The new apartments behind the reception area were full but as they have their own flashy new pool, the old pool felt like our own private pool with only a few other visitors over the two weeks. Of course this meant there was no scrapping over sun beds and the peace and quiet meant I could sleep off the previous nights boozing without any disturbances. We walked into the village 12 nights out of the 14. 20 minutes stroll to the first bar. A taxi back from Molly's Bar was \u20ac8 - not exactly going to break the bank is it?

No complaints at all, we were in room 5 which had a balconey from which we got a nice view of the town & castle, although the room is basic it does what it says on the tin. somewhere to sleep, shower and change. we don't go on holiday to stay in the room  Christos and Eriphilly were pleased to see us, as were various bar staff (especially Paul & Martin at the wonderful Molly's Bar) and restaurant owners who we have got to know over the years.  There were quite a few families with children the same age as our daughter Lily this year, which pleased her no end\u2026", "date": "May 2009", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191013-d1074040-r76027614", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Cheap and cheerful hotel in beautiful place", "review": "Just be aware that you may be getting a really small room in the Makres block at least and pretty tired too, think smaller than Travel Lodge,  I could lie in my bed and touch the kitchen sink.  Free kids for First Choice seemed to mean invisible kids as the owners of the studios only expected a couple, so our five year old was given a rusty campbed wedged between kitchen sink and main entrance door.  Rooms are clean enough but think just slightly more up market than a youth hostel.  You get what you pay for of course and it is really cheap.  Pool area had lovely view of castle, bar/cafe prices were more expensive than in town though.   The room got us down at first but a stroll into Molyvos healed any doubts.

There are two buildings block booked by First Choice, containing studios and apartments, a little distance apart and a more modern hotel behind the swimming pool which is let independantly. We were in the Eriphilly, the second building, where there were three apartments on both the first and second floor and on the ground floor, which was a little cellar-like, were studios. These had no windows and only an ordinary door with a tiny window in but they did have a nice patio area.Some people weren't too keen but others loved them.

We arrived at the Eriphilly quite late but were welcomed by the owners and shown to our room which was nice and clean with a small patio with a view of Molyvos castle, stunning is all I can say. We hired a scooter and went eveywhere in the 2 weeks we were there. Eftilou is one of my favourite places as is Molyvos harbour, watch the sunset from here it is beautiful, Oh and try one of their lemon meringue pies ... The Eriphilly is a good 20 min walk to the harbour but with lots of gift shops on the way. They also had 2 adorable kittens which always used to come running when ever they saw us !

YES I loved it ....", "date": "June 2008", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191013-d1074040-r26828659", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "A lovely surprise!", "review": "We booked a last minute trip with First Choice, 2 star  self-catering, allocation on arrival. We had no idea what to expect but what a pleasant experience to be sent to the recently refurbished Eriphilly. The studio was clean and comfortable, even had TV. We had a lovely terrace looking onto the gardens. The pool was a bonus and beautiful, surrounded by flowering bushes and distance views - even to the castle. The pool bar did tasty food. The owners are very friendly. Would definately go back. We hired a motorbike and the scenery is breathtaking.( Food much more expensive than last time we went to Greece but Euro not good at the moment.)", "date": "June 2008", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191013-d1074040-r16714562", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Check in / front desk": 3, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 3, "Service": 3}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}]
