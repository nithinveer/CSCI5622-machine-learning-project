The beach offers sun loungers and umbrellas at 2 euros each and also showers. It is stony as you walk in, but then becomes sandy. The water was fresh in late June and incredibly clear. Great place to swim.  The palm trees between the hotel and the beach did block most of the view of the sea, but then again, they did provide green and shade.  The breakfast buffet offered a good choice which could be taken outside under the trees looking over the beach. What I really liked is that although the buffet closed at 10am, this was \"Greek time\", so it was usually possible to pop back for seconds or another last cup of coffee before it is all cleared away. I do understand that a hotel needs to get on with other things, but I really dislike a strictly enforced sharp cut off time.  The staff were very helpful and friendly, especially the lady at the breakfast buffet. The reception manager arranged a laundry service to collect and deliver for us who did a very professional job, although it was quite pricey.  Negatives: The rooms are rather small.  One towel rail was broken.
