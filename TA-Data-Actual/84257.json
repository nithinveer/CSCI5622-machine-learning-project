Tip- If you walk down to the pool and then south through the parking garage there is a set of steps that allow you to enter the ocean. The water depth is only about 2 feet to 3 feet deep for at least 50 to 75 yards out into the ocean. Very gradual and safe for children.

Last year, I'd booked an \"Ocean View\" room in Daytona which provided direct beach access from the pool area, so this was my expectation for the Clearwater hotel as well. In reality, there is no direct beach access and you'll need to walk 5 - 10 minutes to get to the beach.

Feedback whether positive or negative is important to our overall success.     We strive to be the leader in customer service on the beach, and it appears we failed you in this instance.   While we are on Clearwater Beach, we do not in-fact have any beach out back.  We are terribly sorry for any confusion regarding this.   Crosswalks are available and are strongly encouraged to use just south of the hotel due to the sidewalk currently being closed, as well as there are local transportation companies that will take guests to and from for a nominal charge.  We apologize we didn\u2019t have the opportunity to share that with you personally.    Our pool policy as are most resort hotels in our area, is that no outside food & beverage are allowed in or around our pool area.  We have a full service restaurant and bar on hand to provide our guests with the necessary and food and beverage items they may need.   Regarding the tent, it was in fact left out in the hallway, and after several attempts of finding it's rightful owner, the housekeeping supervisor brought it down for safe keeping in our luggage storage closet.  He did fail to communicate that to our Manager on Duty so that it could have been quickly returned to you.  During the course of our Management Team talking to the Police Officer, our evening Engineer stated that the tent was in the luggage closest. We know it may seem that it mysteriously disappeared until the Officer arrived, but that was not the case at all.    Regarding the Pet Fee, it is fact true that our Hotel only accepts Service Animals.  Service Animals according to the ADA are animals that provide a service or function for a person that is limited by a disability.  Emotional Support dogs help individuals by providing comfort or support.    Emotional Support, Therapy, Comfort or Companion Animals are not considered service animals under the American Disability Act as they are not trained to perform a specific job or task at this time.  Had the hotel been made aware at the time of check-in about the dog, we would have communicated that to you at the time of check-in as well.    Our Manager on Duty was actually on the phone with Holiday Inn Guest Relations at the time it was noted the tent was in the luggage closet, and was still on the phone at the time the tent was presented to you by the officer.  I am convinced if he were not on the phone, he would have been there to ensure that you received your tent personally.    Again, we are truly sorry that you feel you were not given accurate information or treated unfairly.

The Pros: The front desk staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. The hotel is very clean and the room was adequately furnished.

The restaurant has a great selection of food and nightly entertainment. The best part for me was that it is family friendly and kids are welcome! The Cons: The air conditioner is loud and when it clicks on it sounds just like the room door opening. So if you are a light sleeper beware. The walls are also fairly easy to hear through, bathroom noise, coughing, etc. This property has NO DIRECT BEACH ACCESS!!!!!

Please know that the crane was erected and inspected for the safety and security of all our guests.  Careful planing and discussion were had about the location and any risks it could or would impose.  The safety and security of our guests are first and foremost in our hearts and minds.

Normally it is an easy five-minute walk for our guests - or they hop the trolley if they have a lot of gear.  Since other areas of Clearwater Beach also have construction, we know that means our guests have to cross the street, so we do recommend the convenience of the trolley.

However all of this is forgotten about when you see the amazing views and sunsets each day and night, the views of the Gulf of Mexico are out of this world.  Each evening the sunsets are so spectacular they can't be missed.  Well worth paying a little extra for an ocean view.

The suites are good sized, basically two rooms, with one set up as a living/dining room. The hotel bar is a fun place to hang out and seems to attract folks from adjacent hotels, so I'm assuming it's better than the bars there. Restaurant is a typical breakfast buffet/sports bar dining. Won't blow anyone away, but decent. I found the front desk folks to be less than typically friendly. One word of note, access to Clearwater Beach is getting really crazy these days. The Sunday drive to the hotel took over an hour to go about 8 miles. That's not the hotel's fault, but it does make it tough to plan trips to Clearwater or Tampa.", "date": "March 2015", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d84257-r261915637", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled on business", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Expensive for what you get", "review": "When I booked my long weekend in Clearwater I didn't realize it was during \"Spring Break\".

Shephard's was our main focus as we had tickets to a music festival there.  I was able to secure a suite at the Holiday Inn and it turned out to be a great decision.  We flew from ORD to TPA and drove to CB.  The Holiday Inn charges for parking but it was cheaper to drive/park then roundtrip cabfare.  Given the great location of the Holiday Inn, we didn't use the car at all other than to/from TPA.     Check-in was a breeze... the first sign that I booked the right hotel/suite came when I received keys to room 957 AND 957A.

Would be nice to have free coffee in the morning in the lobby as many hotels do. Service very good; scheduled rooming cleaning was always on time.  Travelers with rental cars returning to Tampa airport should be aware that there are no gas stations after you cross the bridge.

Food was good but if you decide to get mixed drinks at the bar try going somewhere else, so watered down it was nasty. Kids loved the pool.  Will stay here again if we visit in the future.

The pool was very cloudy and the wait staff would rather work on their tan then ask if you need anything. The guy collecting the towels seemed very upset and was cussing about something.

This is a nice, updated, laid-back vibe hotel that will be a hit with families with kids, and older travelers...I'm not sure it's the 20 - 30 hot spot, but then again Clearwater Beach isn't known for any visits by the Kardashian clan.  In any event, the rooms are ample size, they have a little sink, fridge and cabinet area which is nice for storing beer and leftovers.  The site has a nice pool area looking on to the Sandkey Pass.  The downside is that you are about 300 yards south of the beach, but its a very easy walk.  The upside is the pool and bar area have some of the best views on the West Coast of FL.

The location is great.  Short one block walk to the main beach or to the left of the hotel is a small private type beach area that is great to relax at. Wave runners and parasailing right next door as well. Parking at $10 per day is a bummer, however, we paid more than that per night in Orlando, so I guess $10 is not too bad.  We did not have trouble finding a parking space, but from reading others reviews I was worried and expressed my concern at check-in.  I was told if we couldn't find a parking space to just let them know. Our room was AWESOME!!

We at at Jimmy's restaurant one night... good food.  There is also a Waffle House connected to the building in the front.  We also ordered room service one night and they were fast and the food was great.  The only downside.. if you want a place that has a sand beach then don't look for it here.  It's located on the inlet and not truly gulf front.  Overall it worked out great and I would stay again.  Another plus for us is Shepherd's Beach Resort next store.

Seemingly this will take approx one year so be prepared before you go.  Other than this the hotel is great.  The reception staff are great especially the main receptionist girl who was fantastic.
