When I entered my suite I was astonished, it had everything I needed, and more: it was big, modern, fresh, excellently equipped. The only problem I had was that I did not want to leave the room.  2. The stuff is very helpful, they could explain to me for hours how I could go to the places I wanted to visit or where I could find what I want. Especially the hotel's manager, Zeynep, has been VERY helpful and friendly. Also there was nothing \"fake\" in their behavior. You would not feel a tourist, but their friend.  3. The location is excellent, just a few metres from taksim square and Istiklal street.   4. The price is very reasonable.  I have the best memories, I will definitely go there again, and I have already recommended this hotel to everyone I know.", "date": "October 2009", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d304808-r46586106", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Location": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled solo", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Best Suite Hotel I ever stayed in my whole travel experience.", "review": "Dear Valued Guest,  Thank you very much for taking the time to share your kind feedback.

When I decided to spend a month, I asked a Turkish friend to recommend a suitable hotel.  This is the only one he mentioned, and I was quickly reassured as I settled in.  My sprawling suite overlooked a lovely park setting with a view of the Bosphorus in the distance.  (Just past a couple of upscale chain hotels costing at least twice as much.)  Yet, I was steps away from a public transportation hub and countless restaurants, shops, bakeries, etc.  This area is teeming with Turks going about their daily lives, so you actually feel like you're THERE.
