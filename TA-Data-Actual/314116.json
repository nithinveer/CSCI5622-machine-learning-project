In some cases, it is better than a three star, in the sense that it has a full sized pool and gardens which one would associate with a four star hotel.  The restaurant food lives up to the standards of a three star hotel, and I would say that it is very good.  The rooms are beautiful, spacious, and all of them with good views.  The only minus is the airconditioner, which simply needs to be changed.   In conclusion, if you want better standards, you would need to pay for a four star hotel.

To me it was a Trip of a lifetime and a week was not enough time to spend there. We stayed in the Hotel Palme, it is one of a trio of hotels situated together. The rooms were basic, but believe me you wont want to stay in your hotel room because there is just so much to see and do!

Only a 10 minute walk to bus station and town which is fantastic . Most hotel staff ok but some are downright rude and could do with a course on manners and customer service . Food ok except the way it was served . You had to choose your meal the previous evening and meal time was 6.30 or 8.30 and woe betide you if you were a bit late . A buffet style salad was first which you rarely had time to eat because the starter was shoved in front you . If you said you were not yet ready the look from the waiter was one of total disgust . When you were ready the food was slopped onto your plate and invariably some ended up on the floor or worse your clothing .

First of all it has been 34 degrees when we have been there, sweltering heat but HOTEL ROYAL would not use their air conditioning and because it all centrally controlled you could not have it on in your room either. We had to sleep at night with the patio doors open which you were advised not to due to recent burglaries in the area.

This hotel needs major refurbishment; carpets in hallways are grubby and worn and the overall appearance of the hotel is dated. There was no shallow end to the pool. The air conditioning was timed centrally, so you had limited control over it. As with most hotels in the area, we were on a half board basis, but we ate out most nights as the food left alot to be desired. My jacket went missing from my room, and after several visits to reception it was eventually recovered, having been \"mistakenly\" taken by the laundry staff.

Take a trip on the lake to the north and experience the spectacular scenery. Ferry trips to various places along the Lake, which we will be visiting next time we go.
