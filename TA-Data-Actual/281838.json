By chance the best restaurant that we visited during our stay, Trattoria Dall'Oste was just opposite the station only 150 metres/yards away from the hotel. The hotel was one of several positiuoned on the Easyjet we-page. Never trusting in-your-face adverts I checked external reviews first and took the plunge. I received huge praise from the members of my family for my 'inspired choice'. Not deserved of course but it really was. The rooms were clean and nicely fitted. The two sets of windows were double-glazed so there was no noice from the street. The air-coditioning was silent but effective. The shower/toilet rooms differed in size. Ours wasa the smallest but all were very modern and clean.
