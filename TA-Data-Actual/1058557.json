We had an enjoyable week. The hotel decor may be a little dated but it is very clean, with comfortable beds. The bedding and towels were changed twice during our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the bar prices are very reasonable. Location is perfect, in the centre of Torbole, 3 minutes walk to the lake and the bus stops are just outside the hotel. Our only niggle is about the food. Breakfast is good with a good selection of both hot and cold items, various breads, fruit and yogurt. Evening dinner was disappointing, a good and very varied salad bar with breads. the disappointment is in the hot selection. Always a soup, 2 quite tasteless pasta dishes, then the meat and fish, poor quality and over cooked. The single vegetable is frozen as is the potato dish.(Wedges etc. most nights) I can't comment too much on the desserts as they are not my thing, but other people at my table expressed their disappointment. My husband had bought a carafe of red wine at the bar and asked for a glass of water to accompany it and was told quite abruptly by the young woman at the bar that he could not have the water, which we thought was quite rude and uncalled for. A friend went up and asked for a glass of ice and was given it. What is the difference?

Torbole is lovely, but a little quiet for us. Best restaurants were the Terrace (on the front) and a little wine bar opposite the bank which does really good food and wine (can't remember name). Hotel welcome was pretty poor, no showing to rooms or explanations of dinner times/other info. Room was fine, in a new block so nice and clean and decent bathroom, good air con. Real issue with the hotel was the poor food, we only\u2026", "date": "July 2009", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194935-d1058557-r33882912", "sub_review": {"Value": 2, "Location": 4, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 2}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "superb accomodation", "review": "just back from this superb hotel,set in the small town of torbole this hotel was everything it promised!.  we arrived at about 9 30 p.m,we had missed dinner,but a cold platter was prepared for us on our arrival,we also had a bottle of wine bought to our table,and i had a glass of beer,drinks were free!!!!!!!. our room was compact,not small,but that suited us,comprised of two singles pushed together,but was ok too. extra pillows were available and so where covers if required,there was a free safe in the room which we used.had a balcony giving stunning views of the mountains. breakfasts were probably our only minor down point,mainly cold meats,rols,boiled eggs,fruit ,etc etc,no english breakfast food im afraid,but you get used to it. dinners were amazing,salad bowl at the\u2026", "date": "September 2008", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194935-d1058557-r20280683", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Location": 5, "Check in / front desk": 5, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Beautifull", "review": "We stayed at hotel club la vela in may 2008 an stoped for 1 week.

The food was nice but the best meal was on the gala buffet night it was beautifull. we went half board which was breakfast and evening meal an recommed that you do that as it was quite dear for food. Alex who worked behind the bar was nice an always happy to help.

There are pros and cons to this place. Overall acceptable apart from the overbearing manager who was never wrong! The young ladies  on reception  were  super efficient and very  pleasent and helpfull.  The 1  lift couldn't cater for all the people at once and no porter service was on offer. Couldn't swing a cat in the shower and the air con only drops the outside temp by 5% so at 35%outside you have 30% inside! Beds were comfy and rooms kept spotless and fresh linen and towels. You either get a balcony or a fridge if there isn't one. fair do's. Can't complain about noise as there wasn't any apart from by the pool !

I have to say we were a bit apprehensive, as we couldn't find any reviews.  However, it was absolutely fabulous.  The staff could not do enough for us - after arriving 8 hours late due to flight delays, we arrived at the hotel about nine o'clock in the evening.  The tour rep had asked all the hotels who were expecting guests who had been delayed to provide a cold platter.  This hotel, however, had the full meal waiting for us, including starter buffet, choice of pasta dish, main course and sweet. The food was absolutely delicious for the whole week, and there was plenty of choice.

There was a good choice at breakfast and at dinner a choice of 3 starters or main courses including a vegetarian option. The rooms were cleaned every day to a high standard. The pool area and garden area were lovely. The locations is central. The views from the lake are magnificent and I would say the best in Lake Garda.
