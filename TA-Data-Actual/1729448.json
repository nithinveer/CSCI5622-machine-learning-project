I have reviewed over 130 places/hotels on tripadvisor - this is not merely a first time user with a bad travel experience. I have travelled independently since 1993. I have NEVER been treated so badly by staff, managers, and owner, or stayed in a hotel where, after complaining about the room not being what we booked, and not being clean, I was threatened with having the police called!! The owner threatened, saying he was a lawyer. He seemed to believe that if we did not stay, we could not leave a review, and was trying to blackmail us not to stay, for that reason. So rude. Anyway, the photos of the bathroom are in the room they put us. They then tried to up sell us a suite - at an extorionate rate. The entry to the suite is where I took the photos with the blue paint peeling everywhere. Do not stay here; it is a smelly dump.

First of all, the entire hotel is excelently placed right on the seafront. Unlike 99% accomodations on Lesbos (and on most greek islands), which have a road (in most cases that's the main road!) between them and the beach, Alkaios is actually a beach hotel. This is very important for families with small kids but also for anyone who doesn't like to watch and listen the cars passing by all day long.  2.
