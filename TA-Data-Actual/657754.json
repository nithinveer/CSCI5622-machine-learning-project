[{"title": "Not a 4 star hotel", "review": "The hotel is not worthy of the 4 star! I\u2019d say a 2 and a half stars!  The room wasn't even cleaned up properly when we first stepped in!  We found lots of hair and dust on the floor and in the bathtub!  The sheets were stained and the blankets were also dirty ... unacceptable for a 4 star hotel!  The bed is actually a twin bed that is very uncomfortable at night because the two beds can easily separate (not recommended if you have children with you).  Other than that, you can hear everything from the other rooms which is quite unplesant at night!  The food was ok and various everyday but there weren\u2019t actually english names for all the food.  Some of it you will have to guess what it is before you eat it.  The waiters were very rude, they didn't understand english (most of them)!  They even took our plates before we finished our dinner without even asking if we were done!!!  I didn\u2019t see this kind of behavior in other contries or hotels I\u2019ve been!  The only polite people were at the reception!  Other than that, the location is quite nice and close to the strip and the main attractions in Magaluf, yet still a quiet area!\u2026", "date": "August 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580303-d657754-r720146231", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Excellent service from a truly fantastic hotel and staff", "review": "Dear cirnumadalina,  Thank you for your invaluable collaboration informing us about what you things it could be improved.

The fact of one lift being out of use did not shadow our experience at all as all of the staff worked hard to make us feel comfortable and make sure we had everything we needed. Sylvia at the reception was wonderful, making us laugh and going the extra mile to make sure that me and my family felt at home.

Our aim is to make our clients\u2019 stay as pleasant as possible and to fulfill their expectations. We work very hard day after day in order to improve the quality of the services we offer. However, despite our many years of experience, it is hard to meet the needs of every individual guest and unfortunately in this case our goal has not been achieved.   As you may know, Magalluf is well known as a destination for fun and nightlife, specially in June. We do not advertise our product with our collaborating Travel Agencies exclusively as a Family Hotel, but also, as stated on the brochure, for friends and young people. However we do offer a good situation next to the centre of Magalluf, a resort for leisure.  We suffer the misfortune of not distinguishing our guests when we receive a reservation. However we always try to maintain a pleasureable atmosphere in the hotel although the guests sometimes might turn out rude or disrespectful. We also like to remind all our guests that good behaviour is required, and any problems or improper behaviour towards staff or other guests will lead to eviction from the hotel.  We have a security guy and all the corridors and bar area are under cctv surveillance.    We definitely do not allow the consume of any kind of drugs in our premises.   When we have problems with behaviour I personally speak to the unruly guests and give them a warning letter. If the situation gets out of control, we call the police.   As the person responsible for the hotel, a member of the HSM Hotels chain, I can assure you that we make a conscientious effort to avoid any disturbances and inconvenience to our clients.

I will start with the good points... biggest plus was the bar, staff there were friendly and efficient, good range of drinks and shots on the all inclusive! The entertainment was good both day and night. Rooms and bathroom were also nice and comfortable, air con etc was good. Was also a lot of other young people there so everyone's up for a good time.  But...and there are a fair few of them...  Food was shocking, i have never tried to eat anything like it, to say it reminded me of school dinners would be an insult to my school. The pizza and chips i bought at the end of a mental night on the strip one night suddenly tasted like a Michelin Star Restaurant in\u2026", "date": "July 2012", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580303-d657754-r134442598", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 4}, {"title": "WORST 4* HOTEL EVER, SHOULD BE A 2* FOOD NOT FIT FOR A DOG!!!", "review": "Good afternoon,  Thank you for your comments.

O MY GOD  this is a bad hotel, as the title goes the food gives u the trotts and the ale is watered down , the only thing i enjoyed about my stay in the don manolo is that i escaped every night out of the hotel.......... i read the reviews on here and me and my girlfriend thought it cant be that bad, it is probably some old stuck-up people writing the reviews. but the bad ones are true ....

On arrival, the hotel seemed black and dirty but on entering the reception area the image had totally changed. Its like walking into another hotel, clean and tidy looking.  As soon as we went to reception for check in, and throughout the holiday we considered the staff to be of an excellent service and were helpful throughout. On entering the room, our first impressions were standard, but being a 3* hotel we wern't expecting anything more.

It was meant to be a family hotel !!! it was full off single sexed groups, with some family parties, the noise from the hotel at night was a nightmare, from 4am onto 7am music blearing, shouting, things being thrown. how anybody could sleep though that, it should never include famillies should be a 18-30 holiday hotel. the food was copable was always hot and plentiful staff were happy and helpful and included pic nic's if you were going to the beach for the day.
