[{"title": "Super location, excellent staff, very comfy", "review": "I spent months researching hotels in Dublin before my trip recently and I am so glad that I ended up at the Drury Court Hotel.  I arrived very early, maybe around 11 AM or so after an overnight, connecting flight from the USA and I was thrilled that my room was ready so that I could take a few minutes to relax and freshen up.  I prepaid my stay (though my rate was fully refundable) and the hotel was nice enough to call me to get my payment info!  The room was very clean and comfortable with ample storage.  While the room wasn't huge by American standards, it was-or at least seemed-bigger than I had anticipated (and incidentally was bigger, with more storage than my hotel in London).  The bed was quite comfortable and even though the hotel has radiators and no a/c, I was able to regulate the temperature well and the room wasn't too hot nor too cold.   The welcome bottle of wine was much appreciated as was the prompt housekeeping service.  While I didn't prepay for breakfast, I wound up dining in P.Macs for breakfast on 2 of the 3 days I was there.  The 10.50 euro breakfast had a couple options, either a full Irish breakfast or a continental that also had porridge as an option.  The Irish breakfast was delicious, especially the eggs cooked in actual butter (or so it tasted) and I really liked the Irish bacon.  The following day, I went light with porridge and pastries which were also yummy.  I wanted to have a pint in the evening but PMacs was always really busy so I didn't get to see how charming the place looked in person in the evenings. (LOVED the red, dripping candles that I saw).  I walked around the city easily and liked that there were numerous places to eat and shop close to the hotel.  The Hairy Lemon across the street was fabulous and there's a noodle shop, also across the street, that provided a nice light dinner on the day I arrived.  Any time I asked a question, the friendly receptionists were so helpful, and it was really cool to meet one from my home state of New Jersey!  Small world!  I really felt welcomed and that the Drury Court was really a home away from home for a few nights.  They also happily got me buckets of ice each day as well.  My room, 401 was reasonably quiet as well.  I only heard a little bit of noise on my final night there but it wasn't too loud nor did it last too long.  I would happily return to this quaint hotel and I am so glad that I chose Drury Court over some other hotels.\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214612-r729680906", "sub_review": {"Sleep Quality": 4, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Excellent location, great value and friendly staff!

We also do our very best to ensure that the hotel photography is as representative of the room offerings as possible. I would really appreciate the opportunity to follow this up with you directly, especially as we have not received any recent comments of this nature to our onsite staff. I would also love to clarify some of the items you have mentioned, as we are somewhat confused by the content- for example \"the chairs and sofas in the rooms & hallway\"- as we have only one room that contains a sofa (without stains or tears) and none in the hallways. Similarly our breakfast offers a full continental buffet, as well as Full Irish items cooked fresh to order, which is definitely more generous than the average breakfast in the area.

However, I am disappointed to read that you had issues with the shower and hairdryer in your room: especially as neither of these issues were mentioned to our attentive staff. I have personally checked the hairdryer in Room 207 since your stay and it is working as normal, so I apologise that we were not able to demonstrate this to you during your stay. Similarly, our beds are a standard length of 6 foot 3 inches, so I am sorry that you found these to be too short: they would be a standard length for all 3 star hotels.  We are also extremely sorry that you were able to hear machinery noises from 7am in your room- a notice about possible construction is something that we have displayed on all websites, and they have almost completed all heavy works, so it is extremely rare that they start so early.   As I say, I am only sorry that none of these issues were mentioned to our front desk staff, either during your stay or on check out when we might have been able to address and remedy some of these concerns.

We are also proud of our central location and being so close to many of the sites, attractions and eateries that Dublin has to offer. Unfortunately being so central, it does mean that some external noise is always possible: even from the top floor room you stayed in. We have done as much as we can to limit this by installing triple glazing, and ensuring that there are fans in every room: with additional available at reception whenever requested. We are sorry that the use of a fan and triple glazing did not seem to solve your issues- and that this was not mentioned during your stay, when we would have done our utmost to address it. Similarly, we would really have appreciated that feedback on your meal in P. Mac's when you were onsite and when we could have done something to resolve your disappointment: whilst P. Mac's is an award winning, popular Dublin spot, we do recognise that its bohemian style is not for everyone. Our staff is therefore always more than happy to recommend an alternative dining location: and our central situation means that there are plenty on our doorstep!  It is a real shame that our 24-hour staff did not receive this feedback onsite, as we always aim to provide positively memorable experiences at the Drury Court.

No qualms whatsoever with room. The Drury, is just a short 5 minute walk from Grafton Street and about 8 minutes from Temple Bar, so very convenient. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Check in was 3PM and they have a room to keep your luggage safe, if you arrive early or if check out is a few hours before your flight. Would recommend Drury Court as a place to stay in Dublin. You won\u2019t be disappointed.

It is just a real shame that we were not made more aware of the extent of your concerns during your stay with us, when we might have been in a better position to address them. For example, the window in room 504 would be considered large for a Dublin city centre property, and our whole team is well versed in fire safety: very rarely would a rescue attempt be made through an external window when there is a fire escape on each floor. We are also very surprised to hear that you were disturbed for the whole night during your stay- whilst the first night might have seen some external noise, being a Saturday (arguably the city's busiest night), the rest of the nights were much quieter, especially on our top floor with the benefit of the triple glazing. I am glad to read that you found our front desk staff to be so friendly- and we shall certainly be passing on your comments to our Housekeeping department, who were absolutely working throughout your stay. Our internal records show that your rooms were serviced as normal, but your comments would be in no way indicative of our usual high standards, so please be assured that we shall be following this up internally. Similarly, our mattresses were all changed in February 2017, and have received generally positive feedback- although this is a subjective matter, depending on what the individual occupant is used to.  The issue with the light in your bathroom was also resolved the following morning- my colleague wishes to pass on her apologies for not being able to offer a more satisfactory solution that evening and has since been shown how to change the bulb type in question. Unfortunately to comply with Irish regulations, bathroom sockets can only be the shaving sockets of 12v, so another socket is not a possibility. As I say, it is just a shame that I did not have the chance to address these issues directly when you were with us: I was on the desk on all 3 days that you were here and would have been more than happy to help. We do hope that you would still return to stay with us in the future, when we would be able to offer you a service that would be more representative of our usual standards. Should you wish to book with us again, please contact us directly, either via telephone or email and we shall of course offer you a return guest discount.

We are very sorry to read that you found the hotel room outdated, as we have only just had a refurbishment of all rooms and have made every effort to ensure that our online photography would give our guests an accurate representation of our decor. We must also apologise for the confusion you mention over the washcloths- as I believe my colleague attempted to explain, washcloths are not something that would be provided as standard in Irish 3 star hotels (most guests choosing to bring their own personal hygiene equipment with them). We had some washcloths ordered in, as we were aware of a high number of visitors from across the Atlantic, but this was a limited number - and down to the last one when you requested them, with no chance to replenish these until the following morning.

However, we are sorry to read that you were disappointed with the room you had booked, especially as this would not be representative of most of our guests' experiences. We are certainly a three star property, and would be careful to advertise as this online to avoid any confusion for our guests. Similarly, we would always ensure that any photographs online are as close to our product as possible: with rooms of a high three star standard in a central location.  Unfortunately, the room that you had reserved was our last twin room on the day in question, and all of our twin rooms do have two single beds. I understand that our staff tried to move reservations around to accommodate you in a double room, but that being fully booked, this was not possible on this day.   We would be delighted to welcome you back in the future, should you be in Dublin again and if you book directly (either via telephone or email), our front desk team will do their utmost to ensure you receive a room better matching your requirements on a high floor (away from any city centre noise).

We are sorry to hear of the issues you mentioned with their stay and that it so detracted away from their enjoyment of their one night with us. Currently the voucher terms state that bookings must be \"made directly with the hotel via telephone (0035314751988) or email (reservations@drurycourthotel.ie)\", but we shall certainly look at updating these to make the required booking process even clearer to all future guests.   Regarding your parents' comments about the rooms, we are most surprised to read that they did not have a trouser press in their room, as all of our rooms have a trouser press located in the wardrobe. Irons and ironing boards are not available as standard in the room (as we are only a three star hotel), but are available upon request at our 24 hour reception. I have checked with the staff on duty the day of your parents' stay, and we did not receive any request from their room for an iron or ironing board.  Similarly, we offer both Room Only and Breakfast inclusive rates on our website, for our guests' convenience, so breakfast most definitely can be included in the room rate should it be desired. Unfortunately for this stay, the Room Only rate was selected on our site.   Many thanks for bringing these issues to our attention and our apologies once again to your parents- it is a real pity that we were not made aware of their concerns during their time with us, when we would have certainly done our best to improve their impression of the Drury Court Hotel. Their stay is certainly not reflective of the majority of our guests' experiences with us and we would be more than happy to follow this up with you directly should you wish to contact us.

However we are indeed most shocked and disappointed to read your review of your stay in our two bedroom apartment- as you have mentioned this is certainly not indicative of the vast majority of our guests' experiences at the Drury Court Hotel.  Similarly, when you raised these issues with us on your very first day with us, we offered you a full refund and relocation to a property that might have been more in line with your expectations. This was refused, and so from this point on our staff worked tirelessly to improve the nature of your stay, regardless of the irate manner in which they were dealt with by yourself, whilst in the apartment and at the reception desk.   We have since thoroughly reviewed the housekeeping procedures in the apartment to ensure that future guests remain satisfied with the facilities and comfort of our two bedroom apartment in our central location. Thank you also for bringing the status of the sofas to our attention; as mentioned during your time with us, updated couches have indeed been ordered, it was just unfortunate that these were not ready for delivery during your time with us.   As we really do value both our customer service and housekeeping at the Drury Court Hotel, we really would love the chance to welcome you back in the future and hopefully address the negative impression you have received on this occasion.

The breakfast was very convenient and filling. We had an early flight out back to the U.S. and they had breakfast put aside for us before they opened the dining room for the morning which was great. Sleeping Friday and Saturday nights is rough though. The club/bar down stairs has the music blasting until early morning with loud party goers outside the windows.

We were given Room 108 - a triple room on the first floor, overlooking the narrow street at the side of the hotel. What a disaster!  We were first woken at about 4am to find the bottle carts from the hotel/nightclub across the street being emptied. This lasted 5-10 minutes.  Then at 6.45am a truck full of beer kegs pulled up RIGHT UNDER OUR WINDOW, and some guys proceeded to throw kegs off the (still-running!) truck onto the street, and load up the empties. The noise was INCREDIBLE! It lasted until about 7am, and we were just dozing off again when\u2026", "date": "June 2006", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214612-r5397237", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Rude reception staff", "review": "We had a few problems with our room some of the lights did not work which we reported and was never fixed. The extractor fan in the bathroom was really noisy and kept us awake. Thee was a hole in by bed covering and the bathroom needed to be refurbished but we put up with this. Dirty linen was left by the lift for the whole of our stay. Breakfast also was not the best in a dingy room in the basement. But I was really upset on how I was treated on reception on checkout because I queried the biil the receptionist said 'oh [--]' and then started raising her voice. I was not going to do a review but I have now sent 3 emails and have never received a reply from any of them. So I now feel I should let people know about the lack of customer care.

The reviews were mixed and the good price swayed me into giving it a try. We arrived at about 1pm. The room wasn't ready. The receptionist took our bags off us, we returned at 4pm. The room was ready. The room was on the 4th floor. The room was spacious. There was a patch on the quilt, The tiles on the bathroom wall were loose. There was tea and coffee in the hospitality tray. The room was noisy as there are clubs underneath and across the road, particularly noisy one night about half two. The breakfast was poor. My boyfriend ordered pancakes which were rock hard. The toaster broke down the next morning. I asked the hotel to book me a taxi on check out morning so I could catch the bus to the ferry. They forgot. We missed our ferry bus and\u2026", "date": "April 2006", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214612-r5019878", "sub_review": {"Value": 3, "Rooms": 3, "Cleanliness": 2, "Service": 2}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Loved it!", "review": "The receptionist welcomes you warmly & are super helpful!! They do things extremely quickly and efficiently, so no-one really can argue about how bad their service is coz it really was gr8!!  Lots and lots of smiley workers, makes ur stay a lot beta!! (u dont often get that in hotels!) Clean rooms, very cosy and nicely decorated, and the bathrooms are nice too. Just the shower is slightly dodgy coz when you turn them off, it turns freezing, so run away from it before it gets u! The only real main problems are that its quite noisy in the morning so it could wake you up!! its fairly close to the river, and temple bar, within very short walking distance. stephens green shopping centre just round the corner to get pressies for families & friends!! Lots of bars and clubs nearby so\u2026", "date": "February 2006", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214612-r4465138", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Great Irish hospitality", "review": "Stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for 2 nights and found the location excellent, staff very helpful, breakfast fine.
