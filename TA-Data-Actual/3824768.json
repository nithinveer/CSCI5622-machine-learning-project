A few notes: - Location is superb but good for people to know that Mae Nam is a quieter part of the island.  - Restaurant at the resort is quite pricey so we did not eat there (We only had breakfasts as we had booked a package including breakfast)- we did make some suggestions on this though. - The rooms are very clean, neat and have everything that one would need. - The staff are friendly and helpful and assist where needed. - The resort is ON the beach which is great!  We were very fortunate to sit with Johnson (one of the partners of the resort) and give some of our feedback and suggestions/ideas on our last morning which he welcomed happily.

Children below 5 years old are free of charge if utilizing the same bed as the guardians. Children above 5 years old, normally, are charged additionally with extra breakfast only. But if it were 4 persons stayed in 1 room, we would normally charge the guests  with an extra bed which we heard you did not agreed with, and the request was made at passed 10 in the evening, which our housekeepers are already off duty.  We do our purchasing twice a week, and since we only cater to a total 26 guests rooms, we don't normally purchase a lot and we priced them reasonably and comparably to others. But we respect your opinion about it and we will certainly  try our best to do better.  We are also sorry if the signage at the main road and on the next street are not visible enough, but mostly, our guests gives us calls to ask for further directions, or if not, we send someone to go and pick them up to the point where it is easy and convenient for them.
