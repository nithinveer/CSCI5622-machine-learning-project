Funny how the sign outside the hotel says Vacancies.  Also a raucous  party in the evening. People are entitled to have fun, sure, but the noise , plus some folks standing on the stairs smoking right outside our balcony  Following day able to change room to the 12th - top floor. Much better sea view Then an enormous crane arrived delivering a load to the roof. Took the entire day. Noise ! The hotel is ideal for families and young children. Couples - forget it. Expensive - you are paying for the position on beach, although no beach beds or umbrellas supplied - an additional cost. Our last morning, leaving 3 days early, the fire alarm went off, the alarm issued instructions and there was an orderly evacuation of the hotel , all 12 floors, to the beach.

The rooms are nice, but there was no dishwasher and the sink did not drain.  An employee of the Jet ski company located outside of Diamond Head, provides service to Diamond Head customers, harassed us when net fishing.  In the State of Florida up to July 1, 2019. It is legal to cast net.  We showed are children the fish and released the fish.  The employee with long hair, who didnt know Florida law, harassed our family which started others to join.  I mention this due to the companies affiliation with Diamond Head.    Other than the sink not draining and the open harassment, our stay was pleasant.

We loved the pool activities and the amenities offered at the beach (wave runners, parasailing, etc.)   I did feel a bit \"nickeled and dimed\" by having to sign out beach towels and purchase a laundry card.  I understand the need for keeping track of towels, but the laundry card was a bit much (not cost-wise, just annoying).  I am not an expert on coin laundry machines, but they seem to work for other places, so why not here?

The place was clean / well kept, we loved the room & screened in balcony. Beautiful views of the gulf.   Now the con's - There was very little entertainment, the bar closed 10 pm Sunday, 11pm during the week. It rained one morning till early afternoon. When it cleared up, the pool & pool bar never re-opened. The resort has no beach chairs; you could rent them for $25 per day.

A few things that was a downer were, the beach chairs and umberlla closed at 5 and the bar by the pool closed early to. The hallways are very dark and the noise you can hear everything in the hallways.  When someone closes their door the whole floor hears it.  It sounds like a gun shot.  It seem the whole area closed early.  We went to the Time square around 9pm and the resturant we ate at said they close at 10 and we had an hour to eat.   The 2 resturants I would recommend is Beach pierside Grill, very good food and the server Alex was very nice.  I would recommend to sit in his section.  The other resturant is Bayfront Bistro, very nice, alittle price, need to dress up to go there.

When I went to check in they did not have a reservation for us.  I was quite surprised and upset!!  They explained to me that they had notified AAA several weeks before that they had no extra rooms.  Diamondhead was quick to find a room for me and then gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for our trouble.  The fault with the reservation was with AAA.
