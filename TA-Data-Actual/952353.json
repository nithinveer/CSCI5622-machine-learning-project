With the capacity of around four thousand visitors it spreads on a tremendous area all the way to the beach.  Rooms are of a european size standard with bath and toilet with bidet function, hair-dryer, King size bed and a balcony. Minibar is refilled daily and free of charge. We had an incident gere when we caught a   cleaning-lady in a closed room with our stuff from the backpack layed out on the bed. We called reception immediatelly to come deal with the situation. Receptionist apologized and promised the manager will come back to us but it never happened.   Variety of bars in the hotel building, along the pools, near the beach and directly on the pier provide a selection of cocktails and drinks. Refrigerators with Water are available practically everywhere to grab.  Main restaurant is where breakfast lunch and dinner are served. Variety of meat meals and vegetarian warm meals, cold salads vegetables and fruits, diet corner (boiled vegetables meat and rice) and specialties section which differs every night. Waiters usually do not notice you and just clean the table after you are done. If you desire some drinks you will save a lot of time and energy by going to the bars and ask for them.  Side street offers different food during the day directly in the pool area. Then there are a la carte restaurants to choose from if desired.  Hotel offers plenty of activities such as gaming section with various arcade games, bowling, billiard etc, small roller coasters and ferris wheel, water slides, gym and diiferent activities during the day organised by the animation team.  Beach is private and belonging to the resort. It is clean with enough sunbeds for everyone.  All in all it was a great holiday (except of the cleaning lady incident) in a resort which offers everything you could think of. Despite the possibilities it doesnt feel like its too big and you can easilly get from one side to another. Service could be bit better and proactive not to wait for visitors to ask for everything.  I would have given the hitel 5 stars but the fact that they did not come back to us when we were surprised by the cleaning lady incident is disappointing.

Food is amazing , hotel has numbers of different restaurant with plenty of cousins to choose from .. Turkish , Italian, Suchi, Chinese and intercontinental so no way to be Hungary !!! Hotel staff is so friendly and super helpful they go out of their way .. We loved the beach bar and the sun batching deck  .. It's so lovely .. But you need to be there early in the morning to reserve a place but I should say it wasn't too bad we managed to find a place most of the time .. Hotel also has live music aka carte restaurant especially for is Turkish guest which we absolutely loved it ... as I said there is plenty of things to do in this placer and we are definitely going back there in September this year ..

The reception area in the hotel could really do with a spruce up, just to bring it into the 21st century and the main bar area just off reception was not particularly welcoming. However we had a Lake Villa Family room and this was really spacious and clean which made up for the 70s styling!  Two really large bedrooms, a bathroom and spacious hall, leading\u2026", "date": "August 2008", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1192102-d952353-r61296286", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "The best holiday ever", "review": "Short review about our fabulous holiday in the Sueno Beach in Side.

Unfortunately, the service and the staff of the hotel knew nothing about kindness and customer satisfaction. The drinks and desserts were awful. We were yelled at by bartenders about why we were so crowded, where they should have been happier to have so many guests around! Besides, one of the students was beaten by the security staff and had his tooth broken.

Me and my friends, students of one of the most privileged universities (Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University) in Turkey, stayed there in April 2009 during Springbreak and were uneasy about the sexual assaults on the beach side and the discotheque. The Turkish customer profile is definitely of very low quality. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially people with babies and adolescent children. The security guards kicked our friend in the face because he complained about the low security measures. The aqua park is unsafe and there are seldom lifeguards on the beach. Moreover, the service, food and drinks are NOT all inclusive. It's not a safe place to stay in Turkey.", "date": "April 2009", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1192102-d952353-r29170516", "sub_review": {"Value": 1, "Location": 3, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 3, "Service": 1}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Not brilliant at all!", "review": "Just a short review about our fabulous holiday to the Sueno Beach in Side.

The all inclusive package included international brands as well as cocktails and suprisingly lovely house wine! Cant recommend this place enough!
