Bizarrely small closets. Dirty, worn down bathrooms. The most unpleasant, uncomfortable beds known to man and sheets that feel like thick paper. I\u2019m not sure if I hate the sheets or the pillows more.   It\u2019s the sheets. But the pillows are terrible too and two of them stacked will still feel remarkably bad.  The comforters are old and dusty and there\u2019s an extra haphazardly shoved into one of the shelves in case you like double the sadness.

I have to admit that the most pleasure I got in Florence was not supplied by Michelangelo, Brunelleschi or any of those fine artists, but by the bathtub of the Londra hotel!

We had a room that appeared to have been renovated relatively recently. It was modern and extremely clean. The bed was very comfortable. The bath was a bit more modern than I would prefer - the shower stall had folding panels that took a little getting used to in order to avoid getting water all over the floor. There is no lip around the shower (and no tub). So, water eventually finds its way to a drain, but may cover a good part of the tile floor before doing so. So, be smarter than I was.
