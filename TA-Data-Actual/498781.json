[{"title": "Great location", "review": "We were 2 couples who booked directly with the resort and as we had a suite we benefitted from the extras this provided. The reception staff were most efficient and helpful, despite a slow computer, and we all noticed the very pleasant aroma that wafted through the area, must be sent via the aircon. The suites are very comfortable and spacious with everything you need. Santos greeted us the first evening and what an asset he is!! He subsequently remembered our room numbers and always made sure we had a suitable table for the 4 of us. The buffet food is very good but the reason for not giving the full 5 stars is that as we went towards the end of the season there did appear to be some shortages on some evenings. We could have benefitted from the \"dine around option\" but many restaurants were closed or in the process of closing during our stay. The pool area is great with loads of sunbeds but again many of them need a good clean and I am sure that will happen when the resort closes down. The cleaning staff are tremendous and put in long hours, some are on duty late into the evening. The local bus stop is right outside and of course ther fare to the old capital of Ciutadella is only a couple of euros. We went in the first week of October but if we were to return it would have to be before the end of September in order to get the full package around the harbour, which is so charming and potentially lively in the evening. This resort is recommended.\u2026", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g658911-d498781-r720687965", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Ideal location for walks, beach and getting around the island", "review": "Great hotel could do with new sun beds, food adequate and the rooms take some getting used to, walk-in shower in the room not suitable for shy reserved people.

I\u2019ll start with the positives.  Reception staff were nice and friendly and alway say hello. The room was nice and clean. The cleaner didn\u2019t clean the cups but didn\u2019t bother us to much. 2 dressing gowns on arrival and clean towels every day and air con was brill, good shower and fully working fridge and safe. Comfy bed with a few good English tv channels. Plenty of sun beds available. We stayed in 122 which had a lovely view and as soon as the door was shut you could hear no noise at all. Hotel is in a great location across from the Harbour with many restaurants to choose from. Bus stop just outside. Recommend getting the bus To citudella for \u20ac1.90pp it\u2019s a great day out. We also hired a car and saw most of Menorca which was definitely worth it! 2 minute walk to the beach. Now the negatives. We went half Board and the breakfast was ok including the nespresso machines if they were working. The hot water for teas was lukewarm and the tables were never set so had to Go hunting for cutlery and napkins. The evening meals were terrible! we only eat there 1/7 nights. There seemed to be the same food every night and most of it was labelled so no idea what it was. 3 nights there was what looked Like lasagne and another 3 nights was some Sort of pork which we had on the first night and would not eat again. I Cant eat fish and there was quite a lot of what looked Like it but again mostly no labels. We looked every night to see if it looked edible but It didn\u2019t! It all seemed cold and nothing at breakfast or evening was covered and I saw a lot Of flies on the fruit and salad. We ended up going to the restaurants around town for the other 6 nights. We find it strange that the hotel owns most of the restaurants around the harbour  yet most of them were closed due to nearing the end of season yet the hotel still accepts guests. We were there when October trials were on so On our last 2 days/nights we seemed like we were pushed aside for the people Booked in for that. They seemed Like the priority to the hotel. On the day of the festival We were refused entry to the hotel at the door by festival staff even through we were hotel guests and not part of the event  until we convinced him we were staying there. Saw management on the last 2 days and he couldn\u2019t be bothered to even look in our direction as we were not wearing a trial top. We were not asked if we needed help With bags and when we checked out weren\u2019t even asked if we enjoyed our stay or if everything was ok. Would return to his hotel earlier in the season and b&b only. \u2026", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g658911-d498781-r720250355", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 3}, {"title": "End of summer suns", "review": "A long weekend stay here was perfect.

Our staff is always taking care about guests but maybe in this situation the phone number given was turned off, without connection or  just a mistake with the phone number.

Talking about Cala en bosc, we are sorry if you expected other athmosphere but from june to september it is a very touristic place so there's lot of people. I really recommend you if you love the island try to come back in May or October.

The restaurant is run efficiently with Jordi heading up the team, who were all efficient, friendly and hard working. The housekeeping team were lovely too, and our housekeeper was always happy and smiling, and kept our room immaculately clean. The pool bar staff were also friendly, efficient and helpful, especially with assisting with the sunbed reservation system.

Great hotel, nicely situated at end of the harbour area. Lots of nice restaurants around it if you are not on half or full board. Food at hotel was okay,  breakfast was best, good snacks at beach club. Drinks can be expensive if you don\u2019t watch your intake. Clear your bar bill half way through your hols rather than at the end. Doesn\u2019t hurt so much then. Cannot praise the staff enough, especially Marina at reception, she couldn\u2019t do enough for us especially when for me when I became unwell during our stay. She is a gem, just wanted to take her home with us. The hotel was quite empty as it was early season but that did not detract from its appeal.

Firstly, in my opinion if we had a basic room we would have kicked off as there is a separate building where these rooms are.

Firstly, a couple of pieces of advice before you consider booking here.  1. The resort of Cala'n Bosch is a busy and bustling family resort, not (as I had the impression from reading reviews and looking online) a quaint and quiet harbour area with some restaurants. There are numerous hotels, kids areas, arcades and souvenir shops and of an evening, the area is really quite busy. This is not to say the area is not nice (it is) but just so that you know what to expect!   2. If your budget allows, do not book shared transfers.

On arrival we opened he fridge and found a bottle of vino which wasn't particularly nice, and then found an adult heart shaped box with adult contents in it.  The wine we drank and the box lay unopened on the table, but when checking out were charged 25 euros.  Now there is no mention of any charge which I think is just a con, disgraceful!!!!
