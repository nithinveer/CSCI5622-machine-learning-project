From start to finish I couldn't find anything that needs improvement. The rooms were spotlessly clean, there were tons of different foods and drinks, the pool was very clean with enough number of sunbeds, and most importantly it is located by the sea. My 10-year old daughter loved the sand beach, no rocks, nothing in the sea. The staff was amazingly hardworking and friendly. They seemed to have a great management team as they all looked happy 24/7.

That was an amazing refreshment after the tiring bus trip to get there.   You get to wear a fabric bracelet to distinguish between all the hotels that are nearby. Those plastic ends can get annoying, so bring scissors!   The room was A M A Z I N G. Very spacious, smelled amazing, the bathroom was big enough for several people and you get to choose from shower or a bath. I missed having actual shower gel, shampoo and conditioner as is a standard in other hotels. But we did get spa robes so there's that.   The pool was very warm for the first few days and then, after the foam party the water went cold - which I guess is understandable if lots of it was changed over? It's not a hotel's fault but kids in the pool get very annoying but then again, the pool is enormous so you should be able to find a quiet place for yourself.   Do get up to reserve a sunbed if you want to stay by the pool, otherwise you won't be able to get any.   The pool bar is great with not only trail mix but also nachos and popcorn to choose from if you feel like your diner wasn't big enough. Lots of coctails though mojitos are pre-prepared, so if you want it non-alcoholic, you're out of luck. High quiality fruit juices with a choice of 100% and even the rest was all Cappy, so nice. Soft drinks were branded as well and included in all inclusive is even imported alcohol, which was unexpected.   Pool snack bar was amazing with a rich choice of baked and stuffed potato, pizza, hamburgers, g\u00f6zleme, waffles, ice cream, salads, fruits, ...  The beach snack bar was great too though we've only seen the grilled tuna once, so it's best if you figure out when is that served if you don't want to miss it.   The staff is very German prone, even if you speak English to them, they like to answer in German, so get ready for that.   Animations are on the calmer side with yoga, aqua gym, darts, beach volley, water polo and possibly boccia and evening programmes, but the animation team is great, particularly the main animator called Max I think?  Lot of choice for breakfast though throughout the days the choices don't vary much but if you wanted you'd be able to eat different meal every day of your stay. I loved those custard & chocolate pastries! Freshly pressed orange juice (do it yourself, though) and carrot juice (try it at least once) available, as well as all hot drinks and all the juices. DON'T eat g\u00f6zleme at breakfast, though, as that is pre-prepared, wait for the lunchtime/afternoon g\u00f6zleme done in the snack bar!  Lunch was good as well but we preferred eating outside because why would you get dressed if you can stay in your beachwear?  Dinners were crowded but always delicious. This is me saying hi to the cook that always made sure to give me stuff freshly from the grill, going so far as to garnish it with condiments! But sometimes there were cultural blends that don't sit well with me - sushi with sardines, spring onions, cooked tuna & salmon... Wasabi wasn't that good either. Spring rolls with cheese and dill? But the rest was delicious, watermelon and melon usually amazingly sweet. I loved the roasted carrots, duck, chicken, seafood, ....   There's a sort of pool service when a very nice waitress gives out frozen aromatic towels that are the best refreshment you can imagine. Sometimes in the morning you can get coffee straight on your sunbed. Sometimes in the afternoon watermelon, ayran, bottled water, fruit cocktails,... Amazing.   The beach is usually clear, sea warm. Seashells if you bother to look (and I always do). But because it's so great, the sea is very crowded. Sometimes big waves (love that). Sunbeds here are usually only half taken, so don't worry about space there!  Loved the hotel's attitude towards cats.   I'd recommend going to see tortoises after breakfast to a bridge that is right next to the hotel close to the beach.   Also, probably one of the cleanest hotels I've ever seen with rooms always smelling nicely, cleaners cleaning the OUTSIDE of balconies, beach walk being getting rid from sand regularly...\u2026", "date": "August 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d1747320-r700997548", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "2018 Summer Vacation in Antalya", "review": "Dear guest,  we are pleased that you were satisfied and that spent a nice holiday in our Hotel.

After a so-so vacation in Antalya last year, we gave the Turkish Riviera another try. This time at Sunis Evren Beach Resort & Spa near Side. It was the best choice we ever made!It's a beautiful 5-star hotel (albeit in need of some renovations). Not too big, but big enough to give the guests enough space to enjoy themselves. The staff is mostly very friendly (a few exceptions sadly). We were welcomed with cocktails and sweets and got checked in, in a knick of time.   The rooms (we had a family room) are good but need some attention (door of the bathroom with some water damage underneath). Airconditioning works perfectly and keeps the room very cool (if you want to). The mini bar gets refilled daily (softdrinks, water and beer).  There's ample storage space for your clothes and also a safe for your valuables.  They're a bit noisy though. You could hear... \"sounds\" from other rooms. A family we met had quite a few sleepless nights due to a baby crying all night long while her parents were fighting all through the night. Not really relaxing. We were lucky though to have nice and quiet neighbors.   Loved the food! The buffet restaurant offers great and varied food catering to the tastes of the different visiting nationalities. Never had a bad meal there. We tried the Mexican and Italian a la carte and the BBQ dinner. Food is abundant with 5 courses to choose from. We couldn't finish all the courses so we limited our order to 4 courses. The BBQ wat our favorite though! Each table gets one BBQ with is ready to go when you arrive. Great selection of meats and chicken. Great side dishes. When we managed to finish the meat, the waiter offered to put another plate of meat for us! Talk about service!  The beach is nice with warm waters (in August) but the sands get HOT from midday on. There are a lot of lounges underneath sunshades.  The beach bar is also very good and offers drinks and food, so you don't have to walk back to the hotel for lunch.   The pool area is very nice with a lot of palmtrees around. Due to the free form, there one area where the animation team does its stuff without the rest of the pool being bothered by the waterplay or music. The team of very friendly and do great stuff with the kids. But they're not abundantly present and aren't pushy for you to participate. Our kids enjoyed the 5 waterslides and played there daily. The lifeguards should do a better job at guiding people when going off the larger slides. I've seen many incidents where little kids got hit by others coming down the slide (from up in the tower you can't really see if the pool area in the \"landing zone\" has been cleared).  There isn't a run on the lounge chairs but some people do reserve chairs by the pool (at around 6:30 am) although it isn't allowed. But you could still get good lounges after 9 o clock in the morning.   The bars offer great cocktails, ice coffee (coffee with ice cream), tea, alcohol-free cocktails for the kids. Good service. The pool restaurant offers hamburgers, hotdogs, pizza, half chickens, baked potatoes and salads for lunch. And you can also get Turkish style pizza and pancakes with your choice of filling.  The lobby bar is opened 24 hours a day. There's a huge lounge area around it and it's nicely crowded in the evening.  There are some shops which sell fake namebrand clothing and accessories. And a shop which sells beach stuff, snacks, souvenirs and fake electronics.  The only thing we didn't like, was the photographer walking around the pool and pushing his services. He had a monkey with which you could pose but he treated him quite roughly. There were enough people annoyed by this. But hey if you like badly photoshopped vacation pictures, go ahead....  The crowd is mostly German, Russian/Eastern bloc and Dutch. Staff speaks Turkish, German and Russian and some English.   The surrounding area consists of bazaars where all articles are fake. Over and over the same fake brands. The same shops with Turkish delights and spices. And everywhere pushy shop owners.   All in all it was the best vacation we had as a family. We'll definitely return next year for another two weeks!   \u2026", "date": "April 2018", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d1747320-r615200765", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Very nice trip", "review": "I had a long selection of the best money-service hotel at Side and my choice is Sunis.
