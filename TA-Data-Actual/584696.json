[{"title": "Does the job", "review": "We've just got back from our stay at this hotel. It was our first holiday with our 10month old and we were extremely excited. Prior to arrival id tried contacting the hotel to enquire about a cot for our little one but had no replies. Upon arrival the member of staff on reception charged us the tourist tax (which we were fully aware of) but then charged us 60euros for the hire of a cot for 10 nights. I expressed my annoyance at the time but had no choice but to pay it. (I'm still very unhappy about this as most other hotels offer this service free of charge). The cot was absolutely filthy and looked like it was years old.  Putting that aside the room itself was extremely clean and had everything we needed for our stay. There was regular cleaning and the cleaners were absolutely lovely ladies !!!!  There were lifts from the room and ramps down to the reception area but then steps from there down to the pool which posed an issue for us with our pushchair meaning we had to go all the way around the outside of the hotel to get there when we took the pushchair.  The entertainment at night was average and didn't start until gone 9 each night (which we were already aware of) we found the pool bar quite expensive so didn't use it much. The location of the hotel was great and very close to all amenities. Lots of places were closing though mid October so just be aware of that if you're planning on travelling then.  Overall the hotel was ok and did what we needed but we're still quite cross at the charges for the cot and the lack of access.\u2026", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580287-d584696-r720668179", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Another awesome holiday", "review": "After visiting Cala D\u2019or last year, my uncle and I returned this time for a week the apartment was clean tidy tour beds and towels changed for you the staff were helpful and I have already booked for 2020 this time the whole family are coming to visit this amazing place", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580287-d584696-r718190584", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Regular Visitor", "review": "Dear Danny A, Thank you to spend your time to write a review about us.

Although the main part is quite small, the resort stretches bajk quite a distance and some locations are quite remote. These apartments are excellently located within a 5 minute walk of all amenities. I have now returned to these apartments for the last 5 years and know exactly what to expect. The receptionist staff are most welcoming, helpful and friendly and I make particular reference to the experienced guy (not sure of his name) who has been there each year I have stayed there and always goes the extra mile to ensure you have a good and stress free holiday. Rooms are not large but are what you would expect from the price. They are cleaned regularly. The outdoor bar is a great place to relax and the staff are particularly friendly and the place is well managed by the big fella in charge. Great variety of modern musical entertainment each night (albeit the Abba act could now do with an update).

The apts are basic but they are clean and have very good air-conditioning. No complaints at all about it.  If you get allocated apts in the blocks nearest reception, you will be much closer to the 'entertainment  centres' ie. the Tropical Gardens and the Hollywood Bar. They are both very noisy but everything shuts down at midnight. Obviously, it depends what you want - it seemed that many people - whose balconies overlooked the stage at the Tropical Gardens , sat out on them every night and watched the shows from the comfort of their own balcony. Much cheaper than paying bar prices downstairs!
