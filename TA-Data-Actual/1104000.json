[{"title": "Not very impressed", "review": "I stayed here for one night before my return home so that I would be close to the airport. The hotel is clean and quiet, but it could use some updating. Staff was mostly friendly including the shuttle driver. The servers in the restaurant could have been nicer. But this hotel has a lot of little annoyances that added up:  1. Facial tissues in the bathroom consisted of three tissues in a plastic wrapper. Why is the hotel rationing tissues? Good thing I didn't have a cold when I stayed here.  2. The light-blocking curtains were difficult to find. For a minute, I thought I was going to be woken up by the sun rising.  3. There was a safe in the room. But it had no key. And why is it using a key in the first place? Even the rural B&B where I stayed before coming here had an electronic combination lock as did the two urban hotels in Spain where I stayed before that. Although I was only here for one night I still feel safer locking up my passport and cash in the safe and I couldn't do that here.  4. There was a noticeable gap in one of the hardwood floor boards, as if things were done carelessly or cheaply here. I've provided a photo.  5. The water temperature in the shower was uneven. I was constantly adjusting it.  I am not normally a \"nit picker\" (go read my other hotel reviews to see), but this kind of stuff made me feel like I wasn't getting a good value for my money.  I'm unlikely to stay here again the next time I'm in Barcelona - I'll likely go with another hotel near the airport next time.\u2026", "date": "October 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g911483-d1104000-r726184941", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Awesome ", "review": "Dear Guest,  Thank you for leaving your extensive review on Tripadvisor.

I have experienced this myself and I know how frustrating it can be especially when it happens outside your own country.   Barcelona as you are aware of has a problem with professional pick pockets that works all over Barcelona and many times in and around hotels. As hotels we feel that we have a responsibility, even though our lobby is a public place, and we of course do our utmost to ensure that there are no incidents of this type in our establishment. Sometime this can be very difficult as the thief many times camouflage themselves as visitors to the congress. Fortunately we have very few incidents of this type in our hotel.  We work very closely with the local police and during the week of the Mobile World Congress we had extra security hired during all the mornings and evenings.  As you could see for yourself in the CCTV footages the thief needed less than one minute to enter the lobby, steal the handbag that was left unattended and leave the hotel.    This scenario differs a lot with what you have described above as thief roaming around in the lobby. And your comments that the staff in any way should be part of the crime is of course not true and I think disrespectful to our staff who always try their best to make sure all our guest feel as comfortable as possible.   We of course take an incident as this very serious and we called for the local police straight away who came to see the footage and to communicate with their colleagues in order to do their best to recover the stolen items. Some of the police do not speak English so in order to make a report they normally direct you to the closest police station.  We do have free shuttles to and from the airport all day long and almost all night so I do not understand that we didn\u2019t' arrange a shuttle back from the airport police station.   Again, I am very sorry for your terrible experience with these pick pockets and if you wish to discuss this further please do not hesitate to contact me on dircdp@salleshotels.com.

The room was comfortable, the complimentary wi-fi was excellent and the bar service for coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening was friendly and efficient (and English speaking). The free shuttle whisked me back to the airport on my departure.  The pool is tiny and not really suitable for proper swimming.
