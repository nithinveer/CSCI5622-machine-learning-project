Very friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable room. Leisure facilities good but disappointed we had to pay to use them. Word of advice - don't arrive in the dark, it's not the easiest place to find! Breakfasts were great. However the 3 course meal one night included in the package was a big disappointment - the main course even arrived stone cold and had to be reheated.

", "review": " How we managed to find this place in the dark was a miracle! Thank goodness for Google maps but even so it was hard! It was very quiet! We learned that at this time of year the population of Manerba DG is about 3000 which increases to about 60,000 in summer so I'm glad we came in October! Renovation of next door did not bother us at all. If people are bothered about this then it says more about them. Do people expect them to close when renovating? They still have to make a living!! However the place was deserted which was eerie. We did not have any spa treatments so could not comment but we used the swimming pool both mornings and had it to ourselves. Ate at the hotel restaurant one night and it was super. Breakfast was lovely and had lots of choice from boiled or scrambled eggs to doughnuts. Coffee was at best only warm, not hot. I just think I'm not used to staying somewhere out of season and soooo quiet. A car is essential or you could be quite bored being stuck here. Beautiful scenery at the lake. We had no choice but to relax and do very little which was lovely. Got this deal through Voyage Prive. Make sure you ask about the menu included in the VP deal though. Robes and towels for the swimming pool etc are an extra \u20ac7!! This should be included I think. Staff very friendly and have excellent English!!!!

'Borgo dei Poeti' suggests a connection with the arts, but the closest you get is the kitsch d\u00e9cor, including weird, sort of ceramic pictures on the walls, a couple of teddy bears on the landing and 'I love you' written on an information sheet. The female staff are sweet and do their best for you, but the management can be less cosy.  It is easy to find if you have been there, but we found it very confusing on our first arrival, with which the manager was not sympathetic. If you should go, you park in the car park opposite and below the entrance to the little lane, and the first thing you see is the restaurant - this is NOT the entrance to the hotel which is at the end of the lane on the left.  The outlook is pleasant enough, and there is a veranda with tables to enjoy an evening drink, but when we were there, there were major building works going on, and at times the din was horrendous. It is also less than poetic to be right next door to a building site - I think they are enlarging the hotel a lot, or it may just be a renovation. Inside, it's all clean enough, and great if you like kitsch. There is a television that is left on all the time with its sound off, I'm not sure why. We were kindly given the biggest room (101) on the first floor, which was quite large and had a good veranda, which had not been cleaned nor swept for some time. Bed clothes were red, which was different. The bathroom was decent, but the sink plug mechanism fell apart and our room was not made up on our 2nd day there (of 3). This may have been because we didn't leave the room till about 11.40am, but it should have been done. There was a decent choice for breakfast, and the girls did their best, but the coffee was only warm. However, you could ask for a coffee from the machine which the staff made on demand. Scrambled eggs were lying in a covered dish\u2026", "date": "September 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664151-d1751301-r424097084", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Disappointing not a Spa Hotel", "review": "This was a week by Lake Garda to celebrate a retirement with friends and this hotel was disappointing in so many ways. The Spa had no treatments and the indoor pool area is lacking in furniture and comforts. There are NO views of the Lake from the hotel as it is situated at the rear of a B&B which has the Lake views. The terrace at the rear is tired however the furniture is new but has no padding so sitting out for breakfast was uncomfortable and there are large green frogs and gnomes situated around the terrace with little connection to the environment! We had a room that looked over the terrace and the building site as the property attached to the left is having work carried out and started work early.

The terrace is equipped with new pillows bought in June 2016, so this is a lie! The work in the house next door, are suspended from July, so there were never bothered you! The hotel was built in 2010, so how can they be old rooms ??? In the hotel there are objects to furnish as teddy bears and other dolls, which are always highly appreciated by our guests, it is not our fault if she does not have good taste! I remind you that our hotel has 12 rooms, and the bar is sufficient for all types of processing. If it had been more careful, she would have noticed that it was full dishwasher and glasses that sanitizes everything !!! Seen as you left the room, she should not talk about hygiene!  Finally, our SPA is provided with sauna, bio sauna, turkish bath, Kneipp, pool and whirlpool. We also provide a great service of massages and treatments written in 5 languages: Italian. ENGLISH, German, French and Russian can be found on our website, at the reception, and room on the table You probably did not notice many things, because they are too busy drinking beer or wine... not bought at the hotel ...on the terrace! our glasses have made you comfortable right?
