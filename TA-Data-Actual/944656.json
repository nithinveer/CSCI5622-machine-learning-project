[{"title": "Good, but four stars might be too high rated", "review": "Nice hotel opposite the train station Alameda and overlooking the banks of the Guadalmedina river.  It has the look and feel of a business oriented hotel. We experienced a friendly but somewhat uninterested and cold reception by a receptionist who does not very well speak English and that might have been the reason the check-in feels somewhat impersonal. Rooms are spacious with lots of storage space and TV and coffee/tea making is provided  Our room had a nice firm king-size bed with enough space to walk around it. The bathroom is neat and clean, with all necessities provided. Hotel location is fine to explore Malaga on foot.   Two things are however lacking to qualify for a full four star rating:  1) A decent amount of power sockets to charge phones/tablets/laptops, especially at the side of the bed  2) A bar or lounge where you can enjoy a drink when returning from whatever you were doing in the city. There is some seating space, but this is often also used as office space by local businesspeople.  we did not try the breakfast. I cannot see a reason to book an expensive continental buffet when all we need in the morning is a cup of coffee, an orange juice and a toast with tomato and ham. We had breakfast for under \u20ac10 for the two of us at the local panaderia's\u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187438-d944656-r727762682", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Excellent location ", "review": "Literally 2/3 mins from the railway station.

I arrived at 1 AM and needed to park the car for a while in front of the hotel. Maximum allowance by the receptionist was 15 minutes and I had to look for parking at 1 AM at night.  I woke up to a car using the luggage drop off area to park. The same car kept on using that space as parking and invading the luggage drop off area for about 2 days. Hotel did nothing about it.

Extremely happy with our room- we didn't get great weather so nice to have somewhere comfortable to come back and relax in after rainy sightseeing - wifi, tv with international channels etc. Hotel is central, walking distance from shopping area, nightlife, beaches and directly across from excellent Contemporary Art Museum. Also walking distance to train and bus station linking airport. Only negative is there is no tea/coffee facilities in room but i think this is normal for most Spanish hotels? Unfortunately you couldn't get hot drinks in the hotel late at night as the bar is small\u2026", "date": "December 2008", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187438-d944656-r23407980", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with friends", "rating": 5}]
