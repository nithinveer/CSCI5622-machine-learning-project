[{"title": "Fantastic  ", "review": "I stayed here with my husband for 7 nights as part of our honeymoon of 2 weeks in Thailand. On arrival we were greeted at the entrance with men there to take our bags, we were then shown to to reception whereby we got checked in by Tin who was very welcoming and had welcome drinks and cold towels waiting for us. He asked if it was a special occasion to which we replied and he offered a room upgrade at an additional cost then showed us the difference with pictures on an iPad. We decided to upgrade, so we were told there would be a little wait for the room to be made up, so we went to the coffee shop downstairs which was lovely and had a good selection but beware of the 10% service charge and 7% tax on top of the price shown on the menu. We finished our refreshments, then Tin appeared to say that there were two options available for our room upgrade and he suggested which one was best, so we went for that one which meant a longer wait but we were happy to wait in the reception and soak up the beauty of the hotel! Once the room was ready Tin showed us to the room and explained where everything was and then our luggage soon appeared at the door. The hotel had 3 restaurants (Thai, Italian and Japanese) all of which we tried, all were lovely and the service was great with friendly staff. Now onto the breakfast... There is so much choice!!! Which included the usual cooked breakfast (egg station, different types of sausage) Asian, Indian, a bakery section which had crepes, donuts and waffles, a beverages which has freshly prepared juices and smoothies. There is plenty of seating in the main breakfast area but we decided to sit in the adult only area which had an indoor and outdoor option. The hotel was fantastic but there is not much to do in the local area should you want to venture out. There are a few beach bars which are just a few couple of minutes walk from the hotel but they are mainly Thai cuisine should you want something else and a couple of convenience stores. There is a shuttle bus which runs from the hotel at 100 baht per person each way that goes to Khao Lak and Bang Niang which needs to be booked 2 hours before and a minimum of 2 people booked on to run. We felt it was a bit strep to charge as we have experienced a free shuttle at other from other chain of hotels with a further distance too. Overall a very memorable stay for our honeymoon, special thanks to Tin! \u2026", "date": "November 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2368218-d1418811-r729459341", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Luxury in places but not throughout", "review": "Upon arrival we were upgraded to a pool access room 4003 which was very tired, although very clean and the bed was luxurious as all Marriott beds are.

We are very saddened and sorry that you did not enjoy your stay, which was obviously mainly due to the presence of children. While we always take any feedback onboard and have discussed your review with our senior management team, please do allow us to respectfully disagree with some of the points you have brought up.  I would also like to take this opportunity to clarify, as I had mentioned in the email correspondence we had prior to your stay, what the \"couples zone\" refers to. Our resort sits on a very large footprint of tropical gardens and basically consists of two large U-shaped building arrangements, one of which is built around the family pool, with shallow pools, a jacuzzi lounge area, a slider and a swim up bar while the other is built around the adults only pool, as well as our Thai restaurant Takrai, our Japanese restaurant Sakura and, towards the beach-side another swim up bar. The latter has the couples zone on the first and second floor where we only accommodate adults.  We do have 1.9km long waterways that wrap around the whole resort, thereby also passing below the couples zone, which can and is enjoyed by couples and families alike.  Additionally we have an adults only breakfast area, which is located in the North Wing of Waterfront, an adults only pool area and an adults only section at the beach.  We are sorry that you felt that this was falsely advertised, rest assured we do neither want or intend to falsely advertise the different areas of our resort. What we want and strive for is to provide memorable vacation experiences, supported by Thai hospitality, to all our guests.  We were indeed busy when you stayed with us and had close to 500 guests in the resort, of which about 10% were children.  Once again, we are very sorry that their presence has impacted your stay in such a negative way. We are a resort property and as such popular with couples and families alike and I would agree with you that we would not be the right choice for guests looking for a resort which does not cater to families at all.  I am very sorry that we did not have the chance to meet personally as I was myself on annual leave during your visit and would have wished that you had contacted myself via email or Khun Mee, our Rooms Division Manager, whos name and contact details I had given you in our email correspondence, personally, in case that you have any queries or need any assistance during your stay with us.  It is always saddening for us to hear a guests disappointment after their stay rather than during their stay, as this deprives us of the opportunity to find a solution whilst on resort.  dioz, once again, I am very sorry that you did not enjoy your vacation with us and as you do have my contact details, I would be more than happy to further discuss your feedback directly with you.

The Japanese restaurant was also good but you have to make reservations to get an indoor table.

We are very saddened that you did not enjoy your stay with us. While we always do our best to accommodate guests who arrive early, due to being at 100% occupancy on your day of arrival this was quite a challenge for us. Our regular check in time is at 3PM and given that you arrived at 8AM we needed some time for cleaning the rooms of guests who have checked out. Our regular check out time is noon. Danny had offered you the rooms that were already available with only a short wait but since you preferred to have two rooms close-by we had to wait for other guests to check out first. Danny also invited all of you to a complimentary breakfast while waiting for the rooms to check out and getting cleaned. One room was given at 12:30PM and the second room was given at 2:30PM, both before the regular check in time. We do apologize that this was the best we could do in this case. Concerning your feedback about the prices in our bars and restaurants I would like to share with yourself and the TripAdvisor community that while it is absolutely possible to spend 140 GBP for a dinner of two, this would also mean that the couple you mentioned must have had a very extensive multiple course dinner with imported beef, such as Angus or Wagyu, foie gras along with imported wines which unfortunately come with a hefty tax from the Thai customs. Our average prices for a main course range from 10 - 17 GBP and our alcoholic beverages start from just under 2 GBP and average around 5 - 9 GBP for wine by the glass. The cutting of the beachfront lawn is usually done in the morning hours when most of our guests are enjoying breakfast and not during late afternoons/early evenings as most of our guests are at our beautiful beachfront sunbathing or having a cocktail while watching our magical sunsets. We would have greatly appreciated if you would have mentioned that one of your family members is allergic to nuts as this would have enabled us to prepare a breakfast box suitable to your requirements.

I wish we would have had the opportunity to talk during your stay as I would have been able to share what is actually in process with regards to the elimination of plastic here in our resort, rest assured this is our plan.  If I may, the plastic on the beach is not from us thankfully, nontheless it is still very disappointing. The plastic is a result of the major storm surges and wind from the Monsoon bringing the plastic from the ocean in during the last week. We are, as you are, shocked at the amount of plastic at the moment that is being swept in and highlights the enormity of the problem in the this part of the world.  Internally, our bamboo straws arrive next week, this is guaranteed, for your information collectively, Marriotts in our region have made the transition to move away completely from plastic straws, with a number of resorts taking on various initiatives so we are aware on how important this is.  We also will be moving toward recycled glass bottles once approval is granted.

The staff are so attentive, friendly, helpful, courteous, and welcoming.  The grounds were gorgeous.  The food was good enough (as far as resort food goes), and that includes the a la carte restaurants and the buffet.  The pool was amazing - absolutely huge!  It did surprise me a little bit that there was no real shallow/lounging end to the \"main\" part of the pool - it was either 6 inches deep, or 4.5 ft deep -- nothing in-between.  Not a huge deal for a grown adult, but it wasn't as easy to just stand/wade/lounge around the pool in a socializing way (that a 3 ft end pool would more easily allow).

Staffs: their customer service is flawless. they were sooo friendly. No need to ask them for help but they approached to guests with enthusiastic smiley face.

It is a quiet area and there is not much at all in the town. Markets are on roughly 3 days per week where you can buy  souvenirs, clothes and food but its very small compared to phuket.  You will need transport to get to the town as the hotel is too far to walk. It's roughly a 10 min drive into town, you can use the hotels shuttle service for 100 Baht each way per person altho our 2 year old was free. :)  My Husband was very disappointed with the lack of shopping but that didn't bother me as i was there to relax which i did :)  The Hotel:  This hotel is amazing!!! it has a massive swimming pool that winds around the whole resort.

Check in was a little slow but when you're able to look around the grounds, it's really no biggie.   The breakfast buffet is amazing, so much to choose from so there is something for everyone.  We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants at night as we preferred the beach restaurants and they are much cheaper too.  We would each have a starter, main and maybe two drinks each and the bill would come to approx 150-200 Thai Bart (which works out at about \u00a312-\u00a315, I\u2026", "date": "June 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2368218-d1418811-r488862678", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "wonderful family vacation location", "review": "Dear Smcg84,  Warm greeting from JW Marriott Khao Lak Resort & Spa !

The location is nice so is the beach which is wonderful. However, here are some negative points.  1. I had breakfast everyday at the Waterfront restaurant and was with my wife and my 2 kids. I was surprised to notice that no one was willing to help while I was carrying 3-4 plates. Usually, you have at least one waiter asking if they can help and take 1-2 plates and bring them to your table.  2. I went many times to the beach bar asking for coconuts.

We opted for the second one even though it was on the family side because we preferred the direct access from deck to pool. It was very quiet, hardly seen any kids. We really liked the room. Thought I was walking into a spa due to the wonderful smelling oil burner to keep out mosquitoes. All so very Thai. The bathroom was really nice. We were very happy.

The Pool Hands down the most amazing pool you are ever likely to see. 3.1km of canals and large pool sections catering from adult depth to very shallow. We usually don't do much pool swimming at hotels but this pool was something else. In addition the water is very warm (almost hot tub temperature) so you can easily spend hours in the water comfortably. Wing 4 had slightly deeper water which is great.

One improvement the resort made was to designate areas for age 12+.  That made a big difference.  The pool meandering through the resort is unmatched and the beach has to be the best in Thailand.  The food is plentiful, diverse and safe to eat given their standards.

I didn't think this was a big deal until my seven year old son went down the slide lying on his back with his hands behinds his head, as instructed on the sign. He slid down the slide feet first, then as his feet and body entered the water he got a nasty bump on the back of his head (just below where his hands were clasped) from the bottom of the slide. I both saw and heard this happen.\u2026", "date": "May 2015", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2368218-d1418811-r269692061", "sub_review": {"Location": 4, "Sleep Quality": 4, "Service": 3}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Everyone should be so lucky", "review": "HanoiFoodie,  Thank you for making the JW Marriott Khao Lak Resort & Spa your preferred holiday destination and for taking time to share your comments with other travelers in this forum.

Even the basic ones had a hot-tub and spacious bathroom. They also had balconies.  But the best part about the hotel is definitely its pool. Travelled a lot but never seen a pool this amazing. It almost connects every room at the ground level in the hotel. I would actually suggest getting a pool access room because it's totally worth it.

Please accept my sincerest apologies and I will follow up immediately and once more with our team to ensure these issues will not reoccur.  In terms of check in, the official check in time in our resort is 3 pm as mentioned on the booking confirmation and to be asked for a passport and a credit card or a cash deposit is a common policy worldwide in almost all hotels of all categories. We never take any documents further than the reception desk and the waiting time for receiving back your credit card was purely due to the size of your group.  The safety and security of our guests is paramount for us hence we have a certified, trained and qualified security and life guard associate including all necessary rescue equipment on standby at the beach at all times.  In terms of being suitable for disabled guests, we are providing accesible guest rooms and restrooms in our resort. We are absolutely equipped and certified to accommodate disabled guests which is also occurring on a very regular basis.  The 10% service charge added to your bill are entirely and 100% passed on to our associates without any deductions.

Firstly let me start by saying that the JW Marriott is a gorgeous resort. I was a bit apprehensive about holding our wedding somewhere I had never visited, but I was confident by all the glowing reviews on trip advisor, that we went ahead and booked!  To our pleasant surprise, the resort was even BETTER then we imagined! As many people have  commented here, the pool is HUGE (it's more like a lake/river).

When we arrived we were met by 2 hotel staff 1 from the JW Mariott in Khao Lak the other from the JW Marriott in Phuket (caution just remember which JW Marriott you're staying at....hehehe) Anyways after all that we were escorted to our private vehicle and was informed the trip will be under 2hrs due to traffic, we both looked at each other and went \"Where is this place...2hrs really...no way\" But the driver was right it was a trek, but we just took all the beautiful surroundings in and enjoyed\u2026", "date": "June 2013", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2368218-d1418811-r179407272", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "I've Found Heaven on Earth", "review": "We just spent 4 days at this resort.

Their friendliness & little touches just add that something special to a holiday.  We went as a family of 4 with another family of 4.  My husband had a birthday whilst there.  We ordered him a birthday cake from the cake but & he also received a surprise birthday cake in our room.

This was so welcomed, as we had been traveling for nearly 30 hours at this point. Check-in was quick and efficient and we didn't even have to stand at the reception, as the employee assisted us as we enjoyed our drink and sat on the couch. We were then escorted to our lovely room, which was so gorgeous, clean, and we loved the Thai decor. Service was excellent; we ordered ice nightly for our cocktails and we never waited over 3\u2026", "date": "January 2013", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2368218-d1418811-r151852671", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Location": 5, "Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Wonderful 11 out of 10", "review": "Wonderful Hotel, really picturesque setting.
