We were 4 friends and all of us are more than satisfied with our stay. First our family room was very neat and clean, we got every day clean towels and our mini bar filled. Food was very delicious, for everyones taste. We loved so much the g\u00f6zlemes and the donuts at the snack bar. Everything was perfect. The staff and everyone was so friendly. We made new friends as soon as we stepped in the hotel. Hotel is filled with great energy and positivity, its impossible to not feel good while you're there.  As a group of firends we would like to thank everyone who made us feel like we're at home. Ibo from the vitamin bar and Onur who sells Spa packages are the ones who lifted up our good energy. Definitely would come back if we have a chance.

Firstly yes this hotel is mainly Russian with a few German and Dutch and hardly any English so if you want to be with other English holiday makers then this isn't for you the reviews I read stated that the staff don't speak English this isn't true in fact we had quite a lot of conversations with some. I would also like to point out that you don't have to tip to be given good service unlike the Russians and Germans who seem to think this is the way to go. We didn't tip anyone until the last day giving to those that we found to be the best and we were treated very well and I can't complain about that. The only rudeness we experienced was from other holidaymakers but not the staff. I would like to give a special mention to gacdas who worked in the terrace bar not only does he make the best cocktails but he was really friendly had a good chat about football with us and always remembered what we were drinking. Ibo who works on the vitamin bar around the pool was an absolute delight and made us feel very welcome.  Onur who sells the spa packages what a great guy he always sat and talked to u everyday he's fab. The hotel itself is very good clean nice decor the rooms are lovely there's a fridge with soft drinks and tea and coffee making  facilities the bed was big and comfortable we had a pool view which was very nice. The food was good although we did get a bit fed up of it after 10 days  There's 3 Al a carte restaurants but I only went to the Italian which was a nice change the menu is the same everyday so wouldn't bother going more than once tho.  There's a patisserie with river facing outdoor seating which was lovely the Turkish delight is a must.  There are plenty of bars to choose from so never a problem finding somewhere to sit and have a drink.  The hotel is a bit out of the way nowhere in walking distance which is a shame but I defo recommend taxi ride into side old town very good shops and restaurants and a lot more English people there. A taxi costs 12 euros or you can get the bus for 1 euro each.  Green kanyon trip is great very relaxing with a nice lunch included.  Now the entertainment for us was a disappointment daytime was ok activities around the pool and slides open twice a day but the evening entertainment was poor and let's the hotel down unfortunately. Its done in outdoor theatre so you have to move from the bar to go watch it and its very amateur I've seem so much better in other Turkish hotels. So the evenings are quite chilled we mainly just sat and chatted together. They have a foam party near the pool once a week but we didn't get involved just watched from the terrace.  So to recap lovely hotel great friendly staff good food and rooms just let down by the entertainment and if you want to be amongst English this isn't for you but all in all we had a great holiday.   \u2026", "date": "September 2019", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d8690499-r713369912", "sub_review": {}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Can you relax at diamond premium hotel?", "review": "If you want to relax on your holiday, don\u2019t go to the diamond premium hotel.

Top class hotel excellent pool area with water park but very easy to find a quite spot. Or if you prefer the private beach with bar and food facility. Excellent groomed area very good sun beds and shades. Rooms are to a high standard super maid service you want something just ask. Very nice restaurant good food and service. Overall a very high hygiene standard. The hotel is a bit out of the way if you want lots of shopping but bus and taxi outside the door.  If you want a relaxing holiday  good food, service and cleanliness highly recommended.", "date": "May 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d8690499-r374039698", "sub_review": {"Rooms": 5, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 5}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled as a couple", "rating": 5}, {"title": "Good enough... But not really a 5 star location (yet)", "review": "Arriving: the road is not yet paved. Checking in: fast, but full knowledge seems to be lacking, and be advised, I did not get a good map or schedule for all the restaurants and bars. People behind the counter do not always speak German or English fluently (but this is the case for most of the staff working here). Breakfast/lunch/dinner: arriving early means queuing, but at least you have a table. Arriving late means you'll have to flag a waiter to get the cutlery done again. Bars: staff seem not always too friendly. Pool: great size, 5 water slides for the kids, really fun. Be ready for Turkish popular music though. (And if you're open-minded, you'll end up with a couple of them in your spotify playlist afterwards!) Note: there is a bar by the pool but it's no real poolside bar\u2026", "date": "May 2016", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297968-d8690499-r371360740", "sub_review": {"Value": 5, "Cleanliness": 4, "Service": 3}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled solo", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Kunne ikke v\u00e6rt bedre", "review": "We had a Nice rom.

We went there March 2016 for  Nowrooz holiday.  The rooms doesn't have suitable blanket, so you feel cold throughout the night in this season! Moreover, bars, lobby , halls and every where that you can imagine was so cold because there was not any air conditioner system. I was too far from Antalya about 1 hour. Also far from Manavgot, about 40 min. There was not any free shuttle bus from hotel to Side, Manavgot or Antalya. Actually for going to Side or Manavgot with Paying 3 lire to dolmush is accessible. Also with paying 14 lire to bus from manavgot  You can go to Antalya. If you want to accommodate near Antalya, this hotel is not good option. But for relaxing and visiting the historical place of just Side, it would be ok.

Indide pool wasn't warm enough because of the weather in march, and the fact that inside pool doors were not automatic so the cold weather wouldn't let the water to become warm but we used inside and outside pools anyway.
