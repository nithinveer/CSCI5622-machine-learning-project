The room he showed to us was very (very ) small. When I asked him about my second room,, he said I should wait until 7 AM... I told him that the room doesn't fit us all, we are a big family and the room is very small ...he said there is nothing he can do ... after back and forth , he said he will give us a room in a nearby hotel ...I said ok .... next day .. I asked him to give me my second room inside the hotel... he said .. there is no room available.. I said .. ok let's keep it this way .. one room in this hotel and second room in other hotel.. Surprisingly, when we went out and come back to the hotel . We found out that the second hotel removed our belongings to a third hotel without telling us .. they went to our rooms .. took our belongs .. and send it to a third hotel ...

Although the hotel was full upon arrival, despite having booked two rooms and having to stay at another hotel in the neighborhood, the hotel employees made up for it during the rest of the week. The rooms were a good size and the bathroom had all comforts needed. The room was properly cleaned every day and the breakfast was basic but just what we needed. The location is perfect for exploring Istanbul with several highlights and the tram-station in close proximity. Also the neighborhood has several excellent restaurants for both lunch and dinner. The roof terrace view is spectacular and great for relaxing after a busy sightseeing day. Employees are polite and helpful for whatever question you have.

The hotel was really great for our stay. Centrally located, you will have no problem walking to nearby attractions such as the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, and many more. The tramway is also very close. The rooms are spacious and clean with a modern bathroom. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and always on-hand day or night.   The property is rather small, and there is no lift/elevator. Our room was on the 3rd floor, so it may be hard for someone who has trouble with stairs. There's a lovely rooftop deck with a great view and a quaint restaurant on the bottom level.
