My wife said that ladies room was at least acceptable comparing to mens. The name of the hostel is flushing but its toilets are not flushing at all. The rooms were filthy and as small as possible. There was a 5 inch tv in the room. The blankets were so smelly that I just hid it in the wardrobe.

The hostel was located in very interesting and safe area filled with great Korean/Chinese restaurants. It took 30 mins. to get to Manhattan (purple line 7 goes 24/7). Our room was quite big. We had lot's of channels on tv. Staff at reception was very nice:)We could use swimming pool, basketball court, sauna (we just couldn't find time for that).Room service every day.

My room was on the third floor above the basketball court which was somewhat of a downside since you can hear the balls bouncing in the morning, If I stay again I would have to be on the fourth or fifth floor.  Room was clean, no bugs, just smelled a little strange but room had an air conditioner which helped.  Front desk staff was fantastic and super friendly, they do have storage to place your items after checkout in case you don't want to haul it while you are out.  They do have internet but it only works on the 1st floor I did not use it during my stay so I don't know how good service was.  They also have a cafe with coffee and snacks on the 1st floor-Cash only.   Easy access to Manhattan 40 min or so.

Room is small, half the size from what we saw in others photos, can bearly turn around with our suitcase on the floor. Tower is provided and clean. There's aircon, fridge & TV in the room, we enjoyed all the old TV shows. Free wi-fi in the common room, had fitness room, we didn't have time to use it.

I went out, and to my dismay they were still there. By that time it was too late to have them changed, so I just slept on top of the blanked and wrapped a sheet around my pillow cover as, if they haven't changed the bed sheets they definitely haven't changed the pillow covers.
