The head waiter and his staff were excellent and the food (despite some earlier comments) was very good. We had a room near the outside pool which was of a good size and very clean and comfortable. The weekly gala dinner was very good with some excellent entertainment afterwards. The Liberty hotel is situated about 5 minutes walk from the centre of Riva del Garda and its many shops and Cafes, and also the boat dock which offers ferries to other towns around the Lake. We enjoyed our stay and would definately go back to the Liberty again.

I don't dispute that some rooms are a little small even though this has never happened to me.  Ask Reception, they will endeavour to move you, there aim is that your stay is the best that they can make it.  While we were then were asked for extra pillows and the air conditioning to be turned off as I suffer with rheumatism, this was done immediately.  The staff within the restaurant remembered us from last year and helped and made our stay most enjoyable again this year - tipping again as I did last year.

The staff were extremely helpful, very pleasant and all spoke good english. The waiters deserve special mention for working tirelessly every day to ensure that everyone was enjoying their stay. The food was very nice, and although some reviewers felt that there wasn't enough choice, we were happy with what was on offer. The food was typically italian and of reasonable quality, the chef even accommodated those people who couldn't last a week without chips!      The room we had was a standard double and very clean if a little on the small side, although there was plenty of space for the two of us.

And yes, we have been to other hotels, so our judgement has some perspective.  Rooms: beware the attic rooms! You get what you pay for and some holiday companies quote the base price on an attic room. Claustraphobic and hot and not much view. Avoid unless your budget is tight. But, if you have only paid for an attic room, don't expect something better!  Other bedrooms: either in the older building at the front (which can be a bit noisy if right at the front) or in the newer block behind. \"Inside\" rooms overlook the garden with its swimming pool and plentiful sun beds. There are some junior suites with split levels. Rooms are comfortable and typical italian - not \"luxurious\".

We were in an attic room which was just a little small but fine. Only has a small window though if you like views or sitting on a balcony. Room was always clean and tidy. The air conditioning was atrocious though and nearly ruined three days of our holiday. It is controlled from reception and it obviously malfunctioned and if it wasn\u00b4t blowing a gale it was beeping on and off all night. Terrible. The general air of the hotel is nice but I felt that the staff ruined it. The waiting staff were all lovely but the reception staff were very bad. Didn\u00b4t smile much, didn\u00b4t do much to solve any problems, and basically just seemed haughty and miserable. The food was also quite bad.

It was appalling that they had no management covering the weekend.The manager turned his phone off as he was getting too many complaints!!!

They have a fantastic spa downstairs in the hotel were there is also a gym and lovely indoor pool opened late and great for relaxing after a long trip.  The massage can tend to be light handed compared to back home, but it is great to relax the body and mind.   The breakfast was nice, good variety or cereals, fruit, breads and yoghurts tea and coffee with some hot food ie streaky rashers and scrambled egg every morning if you wanted.
