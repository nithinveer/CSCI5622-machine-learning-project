We stayed 3 times in this resort since 2013 therefore we know it well but unfortunately we have seen it going downhill year after year. Our last stay was January 2018 and we decided that we would not come back.  The lack of maintenance is a real shame as the architecture of the hotel, style of the rooms and location are unique. When we visited it yesterday we noticed that they repaired parts of the roof and part of the beautiful exotic wooden floor but still this is not enough. The pool didn\u2019t look clear at all, sun beds in need of TLC, facades in need of painting, etc. It looked like a ghost hotel.  We have seen through the years a massive reduction of staff and although those currently employed are really doing their best, they cannot save the hotel. It is a real shame as this place could be amazing as it was in the past.

The Andaman was so bad that we did not spend more than one hour there and found alternative accommodation in a far-superior 3-star down the road. The owner is over-bearing, the staff do not speak any English, and although we were one of only two rooms booked out of 80, they somehow managed to send us to the wrong room.  The place was messy, dirty, run-down, and eerily quiet.  Not one of the internal phone lines to reception, restaurant, or spa was answered despite trying for 15 minutes nonstop.  The wifi did not reach our suite. Our \u2018Beachfront Villa\u2019 was behind two other beachfront villas, which were completely closed up.  There were water stains down the walls and on the ceiling, no privacy from the resort walkways, holes in the floor and ceiling, and some light switches could not be found.  The infinity pool could not be used, it was green, smelly, and with numerous broken patches of tiles throughout. The owner personally greeted us on our arrival, and then, upon seeing that we were leaving, bad-mouthed our accommodation alternative.

The hotel itself does not have any beach as it managed to destroy all nature with a horrible and huge concrete wall - looks like the container pier in Dubai and somewhat reminds you of a military camp...

This was no disrespect to the resort. The only negative is that it has no bech AT ALL and is pretty remote.

In our room no info on what to do, no room service menus or indeed opening time of restaurant, breakfast times etc. The restaurant looked nice but huge and with no guests would make for a very mournful dining experience.
