Certainly, this hotel's location is convenient for Hynes & Fenway Park. When I checked in, I showed by Diamond HHonors card (and it was on my reservation), but the person checking me in didn't acknowledge it or even give me my breakfast vouchers. When I realized it and came down later, the person who gave me the vouchers suggested that I would best upgrade since the breakfasts in the lounge \"has only cold stuff like bagels.\" This was factually incorrect. Actually, the breakfasts in the lounge were warm and quite nice. Also, I'm supposed to get upgraded rooms as a Diamond member but was given a room on the 17th floor out of 26, and had to pay extra just for a peek-a-boo\u2026", "date": "September 2017", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d111428-r527172147", "sub_review": {"Value": 4, "Location": 5, "Sleep Quality": 5, "Rooms": 4, "Cleanliness": 5, "Service": 4}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled on business", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Close to Hynes Convention", "review": "Wander around this quintessential neighborhood in the heart of Boston for high-end shops, restaurants, and the feeling of city bustle.

We spent 4 days at this location while friends stayed at the Taj. The difference in service was crazy - Bell service was fantastic we never had to wait for a cab - 10 seconds and we were gone - one night we actually past our friends in the cab who were still waiting for cab service in front of the Taj as the bell man was not around - crazy!   The room manager Semir Talic was wonderful as well as the rest of the house keeping staff - extra towels without asking.  Front desk check in was a breeze - as well as check out.

He was awesome and recommended some restaurants to us. The only disappointments I had was the view from the room and the over priced room service. I booked the panoramic Window room. When I looked at a map(using my iPhone) there was nothing blocking the view and of course when we got there there was a newly built condominium across the street! Ugh! I wouldn't really pay the extra to get those rooms.But overall the staff was very friendly and the rooms nice. Good location in back bay too to all of the restaurants, shops and subway.

The hotel is very clean, and the area attractions are very good, with the Prudential Center nearby offering lots of shopping and restaurant options. It's a relatively easy walk to most places from here, and even places like the aquarium can be walked to in less than an hour. The major problem I have with the hotel is that amenities that should be included when one is paying this much for a hotel room, such as continental breakfast or easy to use Wi-Fi, are not included. The next time I stay in Boston, I will likely look for a different option.", "date": "April 2015", "page_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d111428-r265721404", "sub_review": {"Value": 2, "Rooms": 3, "Service": 3}, "travel_purpose": "Traveled with family", "rating": 3}, {"title": "The Hilton of Awesome", "review": "Thank you for taking the time and effort to write a review on your recent stay with us.

When I got to the hotel to check in, they said they don't do free parking unless you book the package through the hotel. When I showed them the advertisement for free parking on my reservation confirmation and on the Trip Advisor site, the manager said he would look into it. When I woke the next morning, they had slipped a note under the door saying it would be resolved on my card, and they actually charged my card for the parking. When I checked out and asked about this, the front desk said they would zero out the additional charge. This doesn't fix anything- they charged me again and zeroed that out.

I deeply regret that you did not find value in our rates.  Unfortunately, Boston is an extremely expensive city including the cost of real estate, labor, taxes, insurance and other expenses related to our city-center location.  Our rates are very  competitive, if not lower, than others in the neighborhood and are priced based on the costs associated with the room as well as demand, stay pattern and other attributes and this is the midst of peak season.  In order to keep our rates as low as possible, they are not \"packaged\" to include such additional amenities as parking, breakfast and wifi which are not utilized by all guests.  If these were included, our rates would need to be even more expensive and not fair to those that do not use these services.  We do offer complimentary internet access in the business center, parking rates are very typical for downtown Boston and there are packages that offer special rates for bundled services.  Hampton Inns and other limited service hotels located in suburban locations do have a different cost structure which allows for lower rates.  For instance, an open air parking lot is alot less expensive to build then a seven story center-city garage.
